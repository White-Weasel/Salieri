A girl is standing in front of me.

She calls my name with an inquisitive tilt of her head.

We are about to infiltrate deep into enemy territory. Yet despite the imminent risk of death, there is no hint of tension on her innocent, childlike features.

Steins Gate. Some know it as Fate; to others, it is the Will of God.


You could count on one hand the people in this world aware of its true nature.

In any case, we should begin the infiltration.

I advance towards Radio Kaikan, which is just across the street from the train station.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Of course, this is enemy territory. I can't just stride through the front door like an average person.

The girl -- Shiina Mayuri -- immediately resumes our conversation. She followed me all the way here, and she isn't even short of breath.

I, on the other hand, am gasping for air with my hands on my knees.

Who would have thought an 8-story building would be so tall?

I turn to Mayuri while wiping the sweat off my brow.

As always, she is quick to understand my position.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
We've known each other since we were both little.

Mayuri is 16 -- two years younger than me -- so she's more like a little sister than a typical childhood friend.

I've been looking out for her as long as I can remember.

I used to hope that Mayuri might become the key to Steins Gate, but now I've reconsidered.

I don't want that terrible fate for her. She should live a normal life.

That is my present wish.

"We're here for Doctor Nakabachi's press conference."

We're standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radio Kaikan. It is here that the conference will be held.

Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. He appears on TV from time to time and has a few patents under his belt, but mostly he is treated as a curiosity.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0012" mode="on">
"Press conference? But where are the reporters?"

Mayuri's right.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
I've scanned the entire hall, but there's no one who looks like a reputable reporter or cameraman.

There are only about ten of us standing in the hall, including me.


Considering Nakabachi's moderate media presence and the fact that he claims to have invented a time machine, I would have expected more.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0036" mode="on">
"Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?"

I twist my lips into a sneer.

I thought that Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting to overthrow the Organization.

But this press conference suggests other motives at work. Our enemies won't miss this chance.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0037" mode="on">
"I'd prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess."

Nevertheless, I'm interested in what he has to say.

That's why I'm here, blowing an afternoon of my precious summer holiday.

Mayuri ponders my utterance for a while before finally turning her head.

I bolt out of the conference hall and run up the stairs to the roof, ignoring the "no trespassing" signs in my way.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00320]
The door is open. Upon closer inspection, I realize that the lock has been broken.

I open the door and see a billowing cloud of black smoke.

There's some kind of phosphorescent dust sparkling in the air.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0039" mode="on">
"An explosion!?"

I can't believe it. Was there really an explosion?


My heart is racing.

Damn, I don't know what to do.

Should I run away?

But why an explosion? Terrorists?

No, that doesn't fit.

I mean, how do you explain <I>that</i>⑰!?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0040" mode="on">
"What the..."

A strange machine is sitting in the middle of the roof.

It's huge, maybe three meters tall, and looks kind of like a satellite.


Did that thing cause the shaking just now?

Who put it here?

Was it Doctor Nakabachi? Is this part of his presentation?

Impossible. Even if that were the case, how the hell would he get it up here?


My head is bursting with questions.


As I search for the courage to approach the machine, a throng of reporters and building staff bursts onto the rooftop.

They look just as confused as I am.

<voice name="Woman" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0000" mode="on">
"Please stay back, everybody!"

And then a woman, who I assume is a staff member, appears to wave us back.

<voice name="Woman" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0001" mode="on">
"The press conference will proceed as scheduled!"

Is she trying to hide something?

Her response was unusually quick, almost like she's trying to keep me away from that device.

Mayuri is nowhere to be seen. She's not in the event hall either.

<PRE @box00>[text00350]
Several <FONT incolor="#ff7080" outcolor="#000000">capsule toy</FONT> machines are lined up next to a plate reading "Birthplace of the Japanese PC".

RaiNet Kakeru is a popular anime series with its own card game spinoff, RaiNet AccessBattlers. They even hold international tournaments.

"Upa" is the series's mascot character. It resembles an elliptical egg with limbs sticking out, like some kind of deformed dog.



It's what they call an "uglycute" character.

There are about 20 people now, including us, but still no media presence to speak of.



So this is the extent of Doctor Nakabachi's fame. No one believes that he invented a time machine.

Nakabachi, in particular, looks like he wants to rip my head off. It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself.

"Someone stabbed Makise Kurisu. Don't know who. Looked bad. Hope she's okay."

I don't know if she was stabbed. That just seems like the most logical explanation, given the amount of blood and the absence of a gunshot.




On the other hand, I didn't write that she was dead, even though I'm pretty sure she was.

I can't exactly explain why I didn't.

If I had to say, I guess I felt like writing it down would set it in stone.

It might make me feel guilty as well.

The thought brings a smirk to my face. It's not like I'm the one who killed her. Why should I feel guilty?

I just saw someone's death up close, and only a few minutes later, I'm smiling.

Over here, nursing a pricked finger, we have Shiina Mayuri. A 16-year-old high school student, if you can believe it. I've known her since we were both small.

She's also an otaku. Nowhere near Daru's level, though.

This ditzy girl is in charge of the lab's official Costume Division (for Women), and today she's working on costumes at her usual leisurely pace.


Why does the Future Gadget Laboratory need costumes (for women)?

It doesn't.

The truth is that Mayuri is completely useless.

Still, there's no way I would ever kick her out.

After all, she was the first one to join the Future Gadget Laboratory.

As I left Radio Kaikan, everyone vanished before my eyes. I can't explain it.

And it wasn't just the people on the street.

The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants, gone. Even the cars vanished, drivers and all.

And it all happened in the blink of an eye.


Suddenly, an empty city spread before me.

I could still hear the music from the stores, but those catchy melodies were the only sounds of life remaining.

Heat was rising from the asphalt in waves, but I felt only a cold chill down my spine.

I just stood there, breathless, until--

How could she laugh at a time like this?

I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
I realized that she couldn't help me.

With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky.



There wasn't a cloud in sight. The scorching summer sun shone bright through the gaps between Akiba's buildings.

Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radio Kaikan, where I had been just a moment before.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite, embedded in the roof of the building where, not five minutes before, I had found Makise Kurisu's body in a pool of blood.



What happened to her?


Just before everyone disappeared, I could've sworn I heard an ambulance siren.

Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark, narrow passageway -- cold, bloody, and alone.

The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my mind was...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0150" mode="on">
"...What the hell is that satellite doing there?"


Right before Doctor Nakabachi's presentation, the building shook like a bomb had exploded. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond it someone had placed a satellite-like machine, shrouded in smoke and glowing dust.

When I first saw it, the satellite was "on" the rooftop.

But that's not what I was seeing now.

This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building, obliterating the room where Doctor Nakabachi's press conference had been held.


It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the atmosphere, somehow.

I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be?

The real question was...


When did that happen?

There was nothing we could do, so we headed back to the lab.

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
And that brings us to the present.

Step through the curtain dividing its center, and you'll enter the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory: the development room.

Just as the name implies, this is the room where we develop Future Gadgets. Needless to say, it is strictly off-limits to outsiders.


Yes, I know the setup is cheap -- I would much rather have an airlock than a curtain -- but our research budget is already scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Besides, what's important isn't money. It's ambition.

I poke Daru and bid him follow me into the development room.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
All of the windows here are weather stripped with packing tape, so it's dim.

And hot, almost like a sauna.

I've been wanting to buy an air conditioner for the lab, but there's no money for that. We're currently accepting donations.

Upon entering the development room, I pick up the lab coat that's lazily draped on the chair and put it on.

I always wear a lab coat in the development room. For practical reasons as well as symbolic ones.

Daru, however, refuses to wear his.

Putting it on and taking it off is apparently too much trouble for him. He can't be bothered to do anything that doesn't interest him. It's men like him who give our generation a bad name.

His lab coat (purchased from my own pocket money, I might add) just sits on the shelf. It's never been worn and probably never will be.

So far, the Future Gadget Laboratory has completed a total of eight inventions.

As I explained to Alpacaman, the lab's primary goal is to develop weapons for the war against the Dark Dominion, led by the Organization, that rules the world from the shadows.

At present, we haven't completed any inventions of that sort. On the contrary. We haven't even figured out what we should make.

But along the way, we have managed to create some ingenious Future-ish Gadgets as a byproduct of our research.

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
Anyway, our current problem is Future Gadget No. 8, the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

"PhoneWave" is a pretty weak name, so I've added (name subject to change) to the end until we come up with something better. For the record, it was Mayuri's idea, not mine.

When a Future Gadget is completed, the three of us discuss what to name it.

I prefer names based on mythology, or names with hidden meanings that need extra explanation to understand.

Daru thinks my naming style too ridiculous. He just doesn't have a passion for words like I do.

Mayuri can't be bothered to remember difficult names. She says they don't "fit" in her head.

And so, our opinions on gadget names are always split.

But I digress.

The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in short, a remote-controlled microwave.

You put food into the microwave before you leave, then on your way back, call the attached cellphone to start the heating process. Voila! Hot food ready for your arrival.

...So it's basically a piece of junk.

A few days ago, however, we discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) has a second, unintended capability.

Our brave -- or possibly just ditzy -- Mayuri had made it her daily routine to heat some frozen fried chicken by remote control.

Long story short, she was defrosting her beloved "Juicy Chicken Number One!" as usual when the unexpected happened.

The chicken came out more frozen than when she'd put it in. The microwave <I>refroze</i>⑰ the chicken.



Since then, Daru and I have been searching for the cause.

I ended up listening to all of Kurisu's lecture at ATF.

After the two time travel theories she introduced at the beginning, she explained the rest with equal eloquence. 

She seemed a little nervous at first, but that quickly changed as she spoke. By the end, it was an impressive lecture. So impressive that you wouldn't think it was an 18-year-old's first time.

She did well to respond to my malicious questions with sarcasm. She's got guts.

Wait, why am I praising her!?

Leaving that aside...

I saw Makise Kurisu dead.

And yet she is alive.

My memories don't mesh with reality.

And not just about Kurisu. My conversations with Daru and Mayuri didn't make sense either.

Everything would be solved if I just told myself that what I saw was a dream. An illusion. It never happened.

But never say never.

I seriously doubt that the Makise Kurisu at ATF was a ghost. 

Regardless, it's natural to seek an exorcism after such an experience. I'm Japanese. It's in our blood.

Yanabayashi Shrine is located on the other side of Kanda River. To find it, enter the first side road after crossing Manseibashi Bridge. It's a very small shrine that doesn't fit with the surrounding multi-tenant buildings.

Kanda Myojin is the more famous shrine in Akiba, but I deliberately chose this one.

The shrine is so small, you could easily miss it if you weren't looking.

Regardless, I can hear the chirping of cicadas from the few trees growing here.

To prove he was from the future, he explained the principles behind his time machine and provided pictures of its operation manual.

But after about four months, he disappeared without ever revealing his identity.

At one point, his predictions gained popularity even in Japan.

Yes, he certainly did get some things right.

But on the other hand, he missed several others. Some of his posts contradicted each other, too. That's why, to this day, most people doubt his authenticity as a time traveler.

So after ten years of silence, that same John Titor is now on a Japanese BBS?

Ridiculous. It's obviously a <FONT incolor="#ff7080" outcolor="#000000">troll</FONT>.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070a]
First of all, John Titor is American. Yet now, he's posting on @channel in Japanese.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070b]
Let's take a look at his posts.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Looks like they've already made an archive of these threads.

Of course, there have been sites dedicated to John Titor for years now.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
This post closely resembles what the original Titor wrote 10 years ago.


I've read one of the books on Titor. That's how I know.





This new John Titor is clearly an impostor.


There are many Titor fanatics on @channel.

He's not exactly a household name in Japan, but I doubt anyone would fall for this level of trolling.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
As I continue to read, however, I find the response the opposite of what I expected.

Everyone is accepting this "time traveler" as if this were his first appearance.

Nobody has even mentioned his appearance 10 years ago.

Finding this strange, I try posting a retort, but everyone ignores me.

What the hell?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
You can figure this out if you do a little research, people!

There's the original John Titor thread archive in English, and plenty of Titor blogs in Japanese.

Wait... only 12?

Moreover, all 12 are about the current Titor's postings on @channel.

I can't find a single trace of the Titor from 10 years ago.

Bizarre. This just can't be.

I searched for information on Titor a few years ago. Back then, I got tens of thousands of hits.

MayQueen+Nyan⑯ is only a three minute walk from the lab.

Coming from Kuramaebashi-dori, take a left at Tsumakoisaka Crossing and you'll find it.

That's where I'm headed now.

It's usually busy in Akiba during summer break, but now it's even busier because of the Radio Kaikan incident.

The area was blocked off yesterday, but it doesn't look like they could keep the main road closed for two days straight. I haven't seen a single police officer today.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
But the Radio Kaikan building still seems off limits. The entrance shutters are closed shut and sealed with yellow police tape.

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0002" mode="on">
"We're here now in Akihabara the day after the unexplained satellite crash. The police barricade has been lifted, and a tremendous number of people have gathered in front of the station!"

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0003" mode="on">
"The satellite's origin is still under investigation. We're told that it can't be removed until the authorities have more information."

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0004" mode="on">
"According to the police, the satellite does not appear to be dangerous. However, tourists and local business owners have raised concerns."

The media has dozens of cameras set up outside of the police line.

And there are nearly twice as many onlookers as reporters. Enough to fill the entire street with people. Everyone's aiming their phone cameras at the satellite-like object.

So many people...

Living in Akiba, you get used to crowds and big events, but a gathering of this size is unusual.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
I wonder when they'll get rid of that thing. I hope it doesn't explode or something.


They've been letting people back into the area, so I guess there's no danger.

Still, considering its unknown origin, I'm surprised there isn't more security.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00031]
Today, like always, otaku are shopping for <FONT incolor="#ff7080" outcolor="#000000">doujinshi</FONT>, import games, electronics, or whatever strikes their fancy.

Aside from the scene at Radio Kaikan, it's the same as any other day.


But I still don't understand what I saw yesterday.

I've half accepted that the mass disappearance was just my imagination.

Maybe I've become unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, like the media likes to say about teenagers these days.

With that thought in mind, I return my gaze to the street.

Among Akiba's maid cafes, MayQueen+Nyan⑯'s popularity is solid, but not booming.

Furthermore, the cat ears and NyanNyanian dialect makes it less accessible to low-level otaku and first timers.

These two viewpoints clash.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00830]
This place is one of the older maid cafes in Akihabara, but it doesn't get much media exposure. Maybe that's what makes it more comfortable than most.

This is wrong.


I remember talking to Daru about John Titor back in high school. It was only idle talk, so it's possible that Daru forgot about it.


Daru is quite the internet addict, but the internet lets you choose what information you want to see. There's no guarantee Daru looked up info on John Titor.

If he had, I doubt he would have forgotten so completely.

Woah, I shouldn't waste all day on @channel.

We have more important things to deal with.

Namely, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). We haven't experimented with it since yesterday.

It's high time I figure out what's going on with that thing.

Earlier, I asked Daru to connect the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to the computer.

He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he's about to do the quick wire work in the development room.

It doesn't actually have to be two minutes. Mayuri had the timer set to two minutes when she first discovered the freezing function -- or whatever it is -- so we're just reproducing that.

Naturally, we have experimented with 60 seconds and 180 seconds too.

If we set it shorter, the freezing only goes halfway, if at all. Conversely, setting it longer increases the effect.

The dawn of a new day.

Actually, it's already noon. We didn't sleep at all.

Sleep deprivation makes the summer sun seem all the brighter.

I really don't want to go outside, but I'm fed up with the humidity inside the lab.


I chug a bottle of Dr P.

My stomach protests. Maybe I drank too fast.

I'm exhausted. My hands are shaking slightly, and my vision is cloudy.

I could pass out if I'm not careful.

Maybe I should take a shower. That should stave off exhaustion, if only temporarily.

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Neither do I. I don't have the energy.

Outside is a sunny summer afternoon. But inside the air is stale and empty of life.

Yesterday, that shocking experiment convinced me that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) was also a time machine.



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
But Kurisu didn't seem willing to accept the results. She just started screaming,

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]

"A time machine? A time machine!? It can't be!!"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
Then she took a mad dash out of the lab.

It was like she couldn't get out of here fast enough.

As for Mayuri, she was depressed about her chicken and bananas, so she skipped her daily costume sewing and went home. Grudges over food run deep, I guess.

Which leaves the lab empty, save for Daru and me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Our enthusiasm shot through the roof when we realized that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) had tremendous hidden potential. We nearly died of excitement after successfully sending an email to the past.

So we stayed up all night doing experiments to confirm whether or not the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is indeed a time machine.

The results, however...

We went to the supermarket and stocked up on a wide variety of items. We tossed each of them into the PhoneWave (name subject to change), but everything failed. No change. Nothing happened.

After the experiment where the discharge phenomenon occurred, everything warmed up normally. No gelification.

Suddenly, we couldn't get anything to happen. We still have no idea why.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
First, let's review the problems revealed by this last run of experiments.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Problem 1.

Electrical discharge safety precautions.


We removed everything flammable from the development room to reduce the risk of fire.


We also prepared two fire buckets full of water. Just in case.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
But that's not a fundamental solution.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
We'll keep an eye out from now on. But if things get dangerous, we should seriously consider relocating our experiments.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
Problem 2.

Mass increase.

When the discharge phenomenon occurs, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) suddenly gains mass for unknown reasons.

Because of this, the microwave broke the table and made a dent in the floor.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
To deal with the issue, we placed the microwave on the floor. We spread cushions and blankets underneath. This hides the hole in the floor, too.

It's only a temporary fix, though. If we make any more holes, Mister Braun is quite capable of raising my rent.

And that's to say nothing of the calamity it will cause if it falls through the floor.

Anyway, we need to find the source of the mass increase. If amateurs like us even can, that is.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
But the first two problems pale before the third.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
This last problem is critical. Until we solve it, we can't even really experiment with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
Problem 3.

We're not even sure of the necessary conditions to send email to the past.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
No matter how many times we tried, we couldn't pin down a single condition.

We spent the entire night doing trial and error. We tried over 40 different things, but not once could we reproduce the discharge phenomenon.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
I had the idea that opening the microwave door was the key. That theory was proven false.

There might be something else I'm missing, but for now, we're at a impasse.

We started off in high spirits, but grew more and more frustrated as time progressed. Which brings us to the present.

Honestly, I gave up. That's why I spent the entire morning lazing about like this.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
Another email pops up on my phone.

I've been getting way too many of these since yesterday.

They're all from Shining Finger -- the woman called Kiryu Moeka.

I've never used email this often before.

Even Mayuri only sends me one or two a day, and she's a teenage girl.

Frankly, this is starting to get on my nerves.

I saw how fast Shining Finger typed. That should've been enough to tip me off that she was a mail demon. I was careless.

Richly-colored cords crawl through a gigantic octagonal tunnel, like the interior of a spaceship from a sci-fi movie.

Based on the height of the people in the picture, the tunnel looks to be more than ten meters tall.


Incidentally, the people don't look Japanese.

Right now, it's 2010. If they actually started that research, it would have been 9 years ago.

According to their official announcements, they only began experimenting in 2008. That's suspicious.

Of course, that's assuming Titor's story is true.

Some of Titor's predictions were on the mark, but most weren't.

I'm also perplexed by how everyone around me seems to have forgotten about Titor's 2000 appearance.

One of those mountain bikes. Its frame is all sparkly, its tires mostly clean. It's probably new.

It looks pretty fast, but whose is it?

Twenty hours have passed since Daru started hacking.

Night gives way to a refreshing summer morning.

I glance at Daru while browsing @channel on my phone.

My discussions with John Titor just aren't making sense.

But how else can I explain it?

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
In my email, I question the differences between his posts now and his posts ten years ago.

The current Titor hasn't even acknowledged the latter.

I only vaguely remember them, but they basically went like this:

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
- In 2015, World War III breaks out. Many people die.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
-  By 2036, the world is a nuclear wasteland.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
-  John Titor travels to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100. The IBN 5100 was necessary to revive technology lost in World War III.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
- The IBN 5100 has a hidden function: the ability to read IBN's proprietary computer language which predates APL and BASIC.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
- But only certain IBN engineers are aware of that function, so it does not appear in the manual.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
- In 1998, Titor meets his younger self and his parents in America.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
- John Titor was a soldier who volunteered for this mission.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
- John Titor is an American.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
Furthermore, in 2000, Titor correctly predicted the outcomes of some future events.

The Peruvian coast earthquake in 2001, the election of a new pope, the outbreak of the Iraq War, China's advances in space, and so forth.

Though he only talked vaguely about each one, they all came true.

On the other hand, other predictions went unfulfilled.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
For example, the <FONT incolor="#ff7080" outcolor="#000000">Y2K bug</FONT>, civil war in America, the cancellation of the Beijing Olympics, the inauguration of America's first female president in 2009, and so forth.

There's more, but let's leave those aside for now.

I'm going to ask him why those predictions didn't come true.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
Alright, let's send it now.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]

She's stopped in the middle of the street, so other pedestrians look at her, wondering what she's doing.

But she doesn't notice their stares. She slowly reaches out to the sky, as if entranced.

And then she freezes in that position.

This is one of Mayuri's habits.

The next day, I decide to hit Akiba's computer parts stores.

I did as much as I could yesterday, after parting with Kurisu, but no luck.

Finding an IBN 5100 is obviously going to be a huge pain in the ass.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_0791" mode="on">
"Hmmm..."

I'm standing in the narrow tunnel that runs beside the Radio Kaikan building. Small shops selling everything from motherboards to resistors to vacuum tubes line both sides of the tunnel.

Here lie the vestiges of the old Electric Town. Akiba's conscience, so to speak.

Casual otaku usually avoid stores like these. It's like a holy land that only true fanatics can enter.


Not that I'm an expert on computer parts.

Furthermore, these shops only sell parts, so it's actually kind of silly to be searching for a whole PC here. Still, something about the sight of all these electronics gets my blood pumping. 


I have to hide my excitement to maintain my dignity. If a storekeeper yells, "Hey, kid! You're ten years too young for this stuff!" then I'll have no choice but to run.

Fortunately, no one has yelled at me yet. In fact, the storekeepers seem to be ignoring me. They must be more open-minded than I thought. Or maybe they just don't care.

I search each store in turn, but turn up neither hide nor hair of an IBN 5100.

Daru, a first-round participant, was insta-killed by Faris.

How weak. And he said I was going to be the burden.

No, maybe Faris is just too strong.

RaiNet AccessBattlers is similar to chess.

There's a special board where you compete using pieces arranged in rows.

The rules are fairly complicated, but basically, the point of the game is to get your pieces into the enemy camp. Whoever gets the most pieces into the enemy camp wins.

Faris is playing against ten people at once.

She moves from table to table in a circle, taking one move at each before proceeding to the next.

In go, shogi, and chess, this is called a simultaneous exhibition. High-level players hold them to demonstrate their skill.


And Faris does indeed seem to be highly skilled, just as Daru said.

Crap. These guys are serious.

I take a deep breath to calm myself down. That's when something strange catches my eye.

There's a woman squatting on the ground nearby, her knees against her chest.

After parting with Shining Finger, I go to a nearby PC store to talk to an employee I happen to know.

But naturally, he doesn't know where to find an IBN 5100 either.

Apparently, it was easier to find retro PCs ten years ago, back when there were more underground niche stores.

Now those stores are all but vanished, driven out by stricter regulations and the inexorable spread of moe culture.

So I can't really say it's Moeka's fault that she's not useful.

After all, I'm stumped too, and this is only my second day searching.

Hunting for an IBN 5100 on a internet auction site is starting to look more appealing than confining my search to Akiba. But again, that would take time and money.

That reminds me, Mayuri called before I met with Shining Finger.

I've met Lukako's father several times before.

He's a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako.


Apparently, the reason Lukako wears miko garb is because his father requested it. Maybe his dad's a pervert. No, it's not like I mean to mock the Shinto priesthood or anything like that.

Now I have to bring the IBN 5100 back to the lab.

But unfortunately, I don't have a car to transport it. In fact, I don't even have a license.

I try asking Lukako's father if he'll drive it to the lab, but he has a neighborhood assembly to attend, and declines with a smile.

Kurisu's been examining the AC adapter and the lab's electrical switchboard for a while. Though we stopped her when she tried to disassemble them.

It's early morning, and she still shows no sign of leaving.

Where is she staying anyway?

She's been in Japan for one or two months, and she did say she was going back to America this month.

The trains aren't running this late, so I guess she might not be able to leave even if she wants to.

But in that case, why didn't she leave before the trains stopped?

Don't tell me she plans to stay!?

No girls have ever stayed over at the lab. Mayuri has a curfew, so she always goes back home to Ikebukuro. Daru and I frequently stay here, though. It's not an exaggeration to say we live here half the time.

The ticking of the clock is like a hammer inside my head.

It's past 2 AM.

The window is closed, and the lab is silent but for the humming of the computer.

We stare at the gruesome image displayed on the monitor, speechless.

I was right. We're in too deep.


I half expect guys in black suits and sunglasses to kick down the door and drag us off to a secret military prison.

Better make sure the door's looked.

Upon hearing the familiar word 'gelified', I reflexively look at the bunch of bananas placed next to the computer.

There's only one banana left.

We didn't have a single successful experiment today, so none of them were gelified.

But I don't think this is a mere coincidence.

The gelified bananas produced by the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and the gelified corpses produced by SERN's experiments.

They seem identical in nature.

We click on a link that says "Ionocraft (lifter)".


It takes us to a video.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00880]
Looks like some dim garage.

But it doesn't seem like anything secretive. Just a garage like you'd see in an average American home.

At the center of the screen is a triangular shape made of some kind of metal. It looks about 10 cm high, and about 30 cm wide.

It's connected to some sort of generator by a thin wire.

Looks like some really cheap equipment.

That's all there is.

Nothing else.

After explaining something in some language I don't understand -- Russian, maybe? -- the person filming the video slowly turns the power on.

And then--

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_0437" mode="on">
"It's floating..."

The silvery triangle floats soundlessly into the air.

Then it remains stationary.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_1250" mode="on">

Kurisu doesn't sound as confident as she usually does.

There is a reserved knock on the door.

Thirty minutes later, Moeka is still taking pictures.

The period between shutter sounds has lengthened, but she's still adjusting her angle for every shot. Her expression is completely serious.

Come on. It's a computer, not a supermodel.

I watch her work from the lounge as I munch on a breakfast banana.


I would have preferred to get something from the convenience store, but I didn't want to leave Moeka alone.

I know the IBN 5100 is too heavy for her to carry, but still. There's no telling what this fanatic will do if I let her out of my sight.

I ignore Celeb Sev's remark.

The prospect of pocketing 200 million yen is certainly appetizing, but that would be too big a change to the past. 

Just like Celeb Sev said, we can't ignore the Butterfly Effect. We should flap our wings as softly as possible.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
I left Mayuri and the others at the lab.

I need some time to get my thoughts in order.

I recall what happened when I sent myself the LOTO SIX numbers. The moment I sent that D-Mail, I felt a strong tremor, and then the world as I knew it "changed" slightly.

The fact that I had sent a D-Mail had been undone.

I know that because it had disappeared from my send history.

However, it was in my inbox. The mail had definitely reached the past.


What does this mean?

The mail was received but never sent. Isn't that a time paradox?


Is that the reason why everyone else lost their memories?

Why did that happen?

The Butterfly Effect? That's not an answer.

Changing the past changed the world. Titor spoke of divergence. When divergence changes, are people's memories reconstructed to match the new "worldline"?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Then how come I remember the previous worldline even after the past changes?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
My deliberations are interrupted by an incoming mail.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
...Tch. I don't have time for this.

It's a mail, so I can just reply to it later. I concentrate on my coffee.

However...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
All these mails...

No doubt about it. It's got to be Kiryu Moeka, the mail demon known as Shining Finger.

How can she so shy in real life and so persistent in email?

There's something wrong with that woman.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
I sigh and open my mail reluctantly.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_1759" mode="on">
"What?"

She wants to send a D-Mail?

That reminds me. Yesterday, I made Moeka Lab Mem 005.

That means she's qualified to participate in our experiments.

Moeka seems serious, so she might meet my demands.

Most importantly, all the other lab mems are completely useless when it comes to D-Mails.

I still haven't been able to verify whether or not I can keep my memories if someone else changes the past.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_1760" mode="on">
"But wait..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I'm worried.

Moeka works for an editorial company. In other words, she's related to the media.

What if she sends a D-Mail and leaks word of the time machine?

We'd be flooded by press. Gone will be the days of lurking in the shadows.

My location will be exposed to the Organization.

Of course, sooner or later we're going to have to announce our findings to the world.

But in that case, I'd rather choose a national newspaper or TV network to cover the event rather than some shady magazine. That way, it'll spread faster throughout Japan -- nay, the world.

Either way, something tells me it's better not to go public through Moeka.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
However, Moeka is a lab mem.

Yesterday, we told her everything about the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and D-Mails.

Moreover, we made her one of us.

It was necessary to buy her silence.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
Realizing that I have no reason to deny Moeka her request, I put my phone to my ear.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_1761" mode="on">

I named this power Reading Steiner. Kurisu remembered.

Which reminds me. When I sent the LOTO SIX mail yesterday, Daru teleported from the development room to the lounge.

Moeka might not have disappeared. She probably just teleported somewhere.

I hope that's it.

In an attempt to calm myself down, I check my phone's history for the mails Moeka and I exchanged.

That's strange.

The mails she sent me are there, up until the one I received on July 31st at 12:43.

But after that...

The dozens of mails I remember receiving from her are gone.


The D-Mail she sent to cancel the phone model exchange was set to arrive on July 31st.

Did a time paradox erase Moeka from existence the instant she received the D-Mail?

I shiver when I realize that I can't find any problems with that hypothesis.

No way.

It can't be.

I mean, all her D-Mail said was "don't change phone models." That's harmless, right?

Moeka still exists.

She didn't disappear.

It was about ten years ago, at the turn of the century, when the world was in an uproar over Y2K.

Near the end of 1999, I had a fever of nearly 40-degrees-C that lasted about a month. I didn't recover until the new year.

At least, that what I've been told. I don't remember it myself. According to my parents, I was unconscious the whole time, tossing and turning. The doctors said it was a miracle I didn't die.

Because of that fever, I didn't get to experience the millennium countdown event.

They never figured out what caused it either.

I find myself giving her a wry smile.

"I'm fine. Don't worry about a thing."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
As I brush her worry off with a shrug, I think back to what happened ten years ago.

When I woke up from that fever, the first thing I saw was Mayuri's crying face.

She's right. I vaguely remember describing my collapse that way.

And come to think of it, it does seem to match with the sensation I felt a few hours ago when Reading Steiner activated.

Sending a D-Mail to a pager.

Yesterday, we argued about whether it's even possible. Eventually, we settled on 'probably.'

Data is data, after all.

The rest depends on the pager radio wave stations 8 years ago, but it should be fine as long as our data gets through safely.

We already googled how to send data to a pager.

For the pagers back then, you would first enter the other person's pager number, then, if in the Kanto region, enter "*2*2".

After that, you would enter the numbers to send. That's how it worked, apparently.

Pagers in 1992 could still only send numbers. Phone number display functions were also yet to be implemented, so your number was hidden from the other person by default.

A few years after that, pagers started to implement Japanese character displays, enabling functionality similar to that of email.

Therefore, the D-Mail Lukako's about to send -- it's technically not a mail, though -- has to be sent in numerical form.

Naturally, I have a conversion table for that on hand.

You can find information even from 18 years ago if you just google it.

I was pretty worried by the lack of information on pagers at first, but that's my little secret.

Recalling the fate of SERN's researchers makes my skin crawl.

Kerr black holes. Ring singularities. Super gravitational space-time distortions.

If you can adjust the lifter's volume of electron injection, you might be able to make the ring singularities naked.

But even SERN is having a hard time controlling the lifter. Even if we do figure out what's functioning as the lifter in our time machine, I doubt we'll be able to solve the problem easily.

Meaning that at present, we can only send a mere 36 bytes of data.

So many things have happened. My memories are a jumble.

Let's go over the events which led to me obtaining the IBN 5100.

I heard that Faris was a retro PC maniac who knew about the IBN 5100.

I learned that nine years ago, she donated her IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. I asked Lukako's dad for help, and he leant me the IBN 5100 just like that. Mission complete.

At the very least, Faris and Lukako should remember what happened.

So that's it...

At any rate, Faris has confirmed that the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.

So did the IBN 5100 disappear from the lab after I retrieved it?

No, Kurisu and the others lost their memories of me bringing it back to the lab. So I'm considering two possibilities:

One. I went to the shrine, but didn't acquire the IBN 5100. It's still at the shrine.

Two. Before I went to the shrine, someone moved the IBN 5100 somewhere else.

Looks like I'll have to go to the shrine after all.

The Faris I knew had never been to an official RaiNet tournament.

And yet now she's about to compete in the <i>tournament finals</i>⑰.

Which means she's been going to tournaments for a while.

Is this the change that Faris wanted to make?

Considering the recipient was her father, maybe he was strict and wouldn't let her go to tournaments.


But is that a reason to change the past?

Faris is only 17 years old. It's not too late for her to start participating in tournaments.

If there were an age limit to RaiNet tournaments, that would be one thing...

It's clear now.

This has to be the result of Faris's D-Mail.

The Butterfly Effect is at it again.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00510]
Faris said she had influence over Akiba's development board. They adopted her plan and embraced the moe industry.

But by sending a D-Mail to 2000, the worldline has shifted to one where that never happened. Akiba is still electronics all the way.


To think that a single mail could rewrite ten years of a town's history.

Is it okay to change history on a whim like this?

I almost feel guilty about it, but since I'm the only one who remembers the original Akiba, nobody can blame me.

It was at a small RaiNet tournament at a toy store in Ikebukuro. We went to cheer on Daru, but he dropped out because of a stomachache, so Mayuri and I ended up taking his place.

If she's going to leave town, she should be using public transportation.

If she's using the Hibiya Line on the other side of the station, then I've struck out.

But if she's going to take the bullet train from Tokyo or Ueno, then she'll have to pass through here.

I carefully scan the thinning crowd around Akiba Station.

Where is she?

Just now, I think I saw someone who looked like Suzuha.

But the run from the station has left me exhausted. I drop to my knees, gasping for breath.





My sides ache. I can't take another step.

Even after searching the entire area around the station, I couldn't find Suzuha.

I guess this, too, is the choice of Steins Gate.

I open my eyes to a deep scarlet sky.

I'm on my back, lying face up.

The sky is vast, and the color ominous. I've never seen it like this before.


Where am I?

I sit up.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
There is nothing here.

A wasteland stretches to the horizon, nothing but rocks and dust as far as the eye can see.

No plants. No water.

No sun. No moon.

No warmth. No cold.

Not a single breath of wind.

It looks like hell.

A frozen world.

It can't be Earth.

Mars, I could believe.

I should just wait until then.


I wait... but the dream shows no sign of ending.

Have I ever had a dream this lucid before?

There's a terrible ringing in my ears that keeps me awake.

I realize that it's the sound of silence.

My belongings are gone. I have no watch, no phone.

The lack of motion numbs my sense of time.

How long have I been lying here?

It might have been only a second.

It might have been three days.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
An epiphany.

The concept of time is a human construct.

The universe at large has no use for it.

Time is a cage that we created to feel secure. Within its walls, we can forget our own insignificance.



I'm thirsty.

It hurts to breathe.

This void is no place for a human.

We're not strong enough to live in a world without time.

Tears fill my eyes.

What do they mean? I no longer know.

I want to die.

Yes, let's die.

But what is death?

To be frozen in time?

Time stopped for me long ago.

How can I die in a world that is already dead?


Everything inside me is crumbling away.


Who am I?

I can barely recall.

My soul is melting into the void.

Is someone there?

Anyone?

Something moves in the corner of my eye.

Impossible.

I try to move my eyes, but I've forgotten how.

And that's exactly how I feel now.

In the depths of SERN, completely isolated from the outside, lies a database coded with an IBN 5100. What secrets are sleeping there?

Could it contain the data from SERN's time machine research?

Could there be proof that the Committee of 300 exists?

The desire to know grows stronger by the day.

It's not just about plunging the world into chaos anymore.

We need the power to oppose SERN's evil ambitions.

And then there's that threatening email to consider.

Daru is confident that SERN won't find us, but I can't afford to take that for granted.

After all, we're up against the brightest minds in the world, the scientists who invented the world wide web.

And they're backed by a secret organization more powerful than any nation.

We're way out of our league here.

They'd have no trouble at all crushing our puny lab if they desired.

That's why we need a trump card to hold against them.

But without an IBN 5100, we can't move forward.

I'm getting restless.

SERN might be able to see everything we're doing.

No. Maybe...

Maybe SERN has been expecting us for years.

How could that be? The answer is simple.

John Titor claims that SERN completed their time machine in 2034. Just two years later, the world is a dystopia under their rule.



Maybe the SERN of 2034 considers our opposition in 2010 a threat.

Maybe they used their time machine to travel to 2000 and install a fiberoptic cable to track our every move.

It's entirely possible.

Has the invention of the time machine started an inter-temporal war?

If so, what can we do?

Our enemy might be stronger than even I can imagine.

No, I mustn't lose heart.

Converting memories... to data?

Kurisu proceeds to explain her thesis.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00460]
Memories accumulate in something called the parahippocampal gyrus - or hippocampus - which is located in the temporal lobe of the brain.

But what exactly are memories?

Kurisu's thesis analyzes that question from a neuroscientific perspective.

All of the brain's functions manifest as electrical signals running through its neurons. Even memories are written to the hippocampus by electrical signals.

Kurisu analyzed how specific electrical signals correspond to specific memories.

The mechanism by which humans recall memories can be likened to a word association game. You begin with a vague, abstract image, which calls successive images of increasing clarity.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_1370" mode="on">
"Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you're looking for."

Kurisu discovered that the number of "retrieval commands" -- nerve impulses used to search up memories -- is surprisingly low. Out of hundreds of millions of nerve impulse patterns in the brain, only a few thousand are related to memory.

It was the successful analysis of these patterns that earned Kurisu and her research team critical acclaim in the scientific community.

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
In order for the time leap to succeed, the target "you" must have a phone whose number you know.


As long as that condition is met, there should never be a problem with setting the destination.

The real problem is what inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is acting as the lifter.

Until we figure that out, we can't reproduce the discharge phenomenon at will. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) will remain incomplete.

On the other hand, if we <i>can</i>⑰ figure it out, we'll have an endless source of electrons that, unlike SERN's, needs no tuning.

I'm exhilarated.

The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is evolving by the day.

Our invention of the time leap machine will put us light years ahead of SERN.

Time travel will finally become a reality.

I can't wait to try it out.

My soul yearns for the taste of chaos.

I barely manage to keep from bursting out in mad laughter.

Come to think of it, more than one week has passed since we sent the first D-Mail, and although there was that strange threatening email, there remains no sign of men in black coming to haul us away.

According to Daru, SERN hasn't discovered our hacking, either.

The next problem is what will happen when we use the Time Leap Machine.

In order to compress a human's entire wealth of memory into the requisite thirty-six bytes, we have to "borrow" the LHC's black hole.

I can't believe that SERN won't notice an unauthorized activation of the LHC.

How do we keep them from finding us?

We need a plan.

After working on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for about an hour, I head to a convenience store to buy dinner.

Daru hasn't shown his face at all today. He must be busy with that part-time job.

I still don't know what he's doing, exactly.

Probably something that utilizes his super hacka skills.

I just hope he steers clear of the law.

While walking, I skim @channel on my phone.

Titor hasn't shown up lately.

I think it's been a week since his last appearance.


I've been reluctant to contact him ever since he called me the Messiah in his last email.

That was about the same time he stopped posting.

Now @channel's denizens are busy slandering Titor. The majority opinion is that he ran away.

I wonder where Titor went.

I tried emailing him the other day, but he hasn't replied.

His disappearance is especially worrying now that I think he might be Suzuha's dad.

I need to contact him somehow.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00680]
This is bad.

Really bad.

This is a threat.

Was it sent by the Organization? By SERN?


Does SERN know what we've been doing?

Should I report it to the police?

Wait, I can't. I just deleted it.

And in any case, a picture alone probably isn't enough to get the police involved.

Still, maybe I should talk to someone. But who?


Not the girls. I can't worry them with this.

I'm the adult here, after all.

What about Moeka?

No. She may be a lab mem, but she's been acting weird lately.

Even if I tell her about this, she won't be any use.

Suzuha... has her father to worry about.

I guess that leaves Daru.

I need to find out whether SERN has discovered our hacking.

What would SERN do if they did find out, I wonder?

They wouldn't have us killed, would they?

Despite my efforts to convince myself that this is just a prank, my feet hurry me back to the lab.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00690]
I burst into the lab gasping for air and quickly lock the door behind me.


Finally, I can catch my breath.

But just then, I realize that something's wrong.

Mayuri and Kurisu aren't here.

Did they go home?

No, their bags are still here.

The lights are still on.

The door.

When I entered just now, it was unlocked.

Would they be so careless?

The memory of that threatening email fills me with fear.

Don't tell me. Were they kidnapped!?

Who took them?

The Organization?

SERN!?

Dammit. It was just a small misunderstanding.

I mean, why the hell did they decide to take a shower -- together! -- when they knew I was coming right back? It's like they wanted to be seen.

Kurisu, especially. After all that talk about not wanting to spend the night with me around, she sure dropped her guard awfully fast.

They're just lucky it was me who walked in on them. What if it had been the Organization?

They need to get serious. We're fighting for our lives here.

Looking at the clock, it's already been more than 15 minutes since I got back.

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
Two days have passed since Kurisu and Mayuri came to stay.


During that time, Daru and I have done our best to support Kurisu's work on the PhoneWave (name subject to change).


According to Daru, it should be easy to use the LHC to generate black holes for our use.

The black holes form at the proton collision point -- where the lifter is installed -- and exist for only a few seconds before evaporating.

During those few seconds, SERN throws a human into the singularity.

We'll use those few seconds too.

The gravity of the black hole compresses matter to infinite density.

SERN uses the lifter to keep the compression under control, but we don't want that.

We're going to dial SERN's lifter down. Not so much that it endangers the world, of course, but enough to compress our memory data to under 36 bytes.



Daru has been coding the necessary program.

As for me, I've been searching for <I>our</i>⑰ lifter, the unknown device that pumps electrons into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and keeps our black hole open.

Kurisu couldn't find anything that could serve as a lifter inside the microwave, so it must be something on the outside.

We're not sure what that could be, and so far we have no idea where to start looking.

Yesterday, I consulted Daru about that threatening email.

But Daru insisted that there's no way SERN could have discovered his hacking yet.

Of course, I had him make doubly sure we hadn't been tracked. His tests came back clean.

I understand he's confident in his skills, and I trust him.

If Daru says they haven't found out, then they haven't.

But somehow, knowing that does not ease my anxiety.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
It's Friday, and although we still haven't solved the lifter problem, Kurisu is just about done with the time leap machine.

Like SERN's Large Hadron Collider, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must have some kind of electron feed to keep the black hole open. SERN calls this feed the 'lifter'.

Nobody replies to Mayuri's off-point statement. We're busy reading about cathode ray tubes on the Internet.

It doesn't take long before we find something interesting.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
A cathode ray tube has a component called an "electron gun," which uses extreme heat and a strong <FONT incolor="#ff7080" outcolor="#000000">electric field</FONT> to accelerate electrons and turn them into a beam.

The electron beam striking the TV screen's phosphor layer is what generates the picture.

An electron gun could certainly work as a lifter.

"We've found the answer."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_1523" mode="on">
"The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave's black hole open."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_1524" mode="on">
"And the discharge phenomenon is the result."

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_0829" mode="on">
"So the reason we can't use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop's closed?"

The Braun Tube Workshop doesn't have especially strict business hours, but it's usually open from around 11 AM to 7 PM.

That matches up perfectly with my observation that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) only works between noon and 6 PM.

The few instances it hasn't worked during that timeframe can be explained by the TV being off.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2624" mode="on">

I see. So it can't be too strong or too weak.

By freak coincidence, the 42-inch CRT's electron gun appears to have exactly the right level of electron discharge.

That's the only explanation.

The Time Leap Machine itself is worthy of a Nobel Prize. We could sell this technology for billions, if we so chose.

No one has touched the Time Leap Machine since that discussion.

Ridiculous as it sounds, I can't shake the feeling that it might suck my memories out and fling them into the past.


Oh, the machine does have its appeal, of course.

We're all tempted by the idea of becoming humanity's first "time leapers."

Yet the fear of what could happen won out in the end.

Perhaps as a way to forget our fears and move on, we decide to hold a celebration to mark the completion of the device.


Everyone feels the need to let loose after working so hard on the project.

Daru comes over to chat with Suzuha, and gradually peace returns to the lab.

Kurisu is in the development room, making a call. Probably to her mother in America.

I sit on the sofa and watch TV while sipping Dr P.

Mayuri sits down next to me.

She peels a banana and begins eating it.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2716" mode="on">
"Yeah, I guess it has."

I established the Future Gadget Laboratory around the time I entered college. It was the first step in my plan to bring chaos to the world.

That was around the middle of March this year, which means it's been almost five months.

Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri showed up -- I'm still not sure why -- and became a lab mem.

For about a month, it was just me and Mayuri. Then, in early May, I finally got Daru to join. All it took was telling him that the lab is just a three minute walk from MayQueen+Nyan⑯. 

This location on the outskirts of Akiba has always been quiet.

Mayuri isn't the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumb jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back in those days.

It was quite a pleasant place to be.

And now the lab mem count has increased to eight. It happened in the blink of an eye, or so it seems.

They didn't come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at MayQueen+Nyan⑯. Or at least she was before MayQueen disappeared.

I remember feeling out of place the first time I came to Akiba, but now, it's like a second home.

Five men burst into the lab.

Their movements are swift and sure -- professional -- and each of them is carrying a gun.

They spread out just inside the door and aim their weapons at us.


It all happens so fast, no one has time to scream.



The men are foreigners, a mix of races, dressed casually in colorful shirts and shorts or jeans.

But their arms are thick with muscle, and their eyes are hard and cold as ice.



Two of them are holding pistols. The other three have assault rifles.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
In answer...

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
Moeka pulls a gun from her belt and points it at us.

I realize that Moeka isn't holding her phone. This is the first time I've seen her without it.


Not like that matters now.

Moeka's gun hand is trembling.

Is the situation affecting her too?

It must be. She's terrified of talking to people.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0164" mode="on">
"Our mission..."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0165" mode="on">
"Is to silence you."

Silence us?

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0166" mode="on">
"Your refusal to come will change nothing."

Does that mean she plans to kill us?

Why? What did we do?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2731" mode="on">
"Who sent you? Who are you people!?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0167" mode="on">
"We..."

Moeka suddenly lifts her head.

For perhaps the third time since I've known her, she looks straight at me. Her eyes are dark and empty.




<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0168" mode="on">
"...are from SERN."

Moeka raises her voice in frustration.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0171" mode="on">

Moeka slowly raises her gun.

She's mumbling something.

Her delicate, frail body falls towards me.

Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings.

Wake up, Mayuri.

You'll catch cold if you sleep here.

If you're tired, you can stay overnight.

Or I can take you home, if you prefer.


We'll ride the train back to Ikebukuro together, like we used to before Daru joined, when it was just the two of us.

<PRE @box00>[text00470]
I realize that Moeka's gun is lying at her feet. Beside it is a small stone.

One of the men Suzuha knocked out starts to moan.

If they wake up, it's all over.

Suzuha looks at me again.

Her eyes implore me to make my move.

If I use the machine, I can avert Mayuri's death.

I might fail. I might even die.

But I have to try.

It's my only chance to save Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Mayuri is standing in front of a grave, gazing at the sky.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
The grave belongs to her grandmother, who died when Mayuri was eleven years old.

Her parents were always busy with work, so her grandmother was her only companion. 


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
I was close to Mayuri's family, so her death was sad for me too.

At the wake, I expected Mayuri to break down and cry.


She didn't. Instead, she spent the whole time gazing vacantly at her grandmother's memorial portrait.

Six months went by.

I had advanced to middle school, so Mayuri and I no longer commuted together.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
But whenever I passed the cemetery on the way home, Mayuri would always be standing there.

Every day, rain or shine, she would stand for hours before the grave, staring wordlessly at the sky as if she could see her grandmother in heaven.



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
In her hands, an old pocket watch.


The watch had belonged to her grandmother. Mayuri always held it when visiting the grave.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2746" mode="on">
"Mayuri?"

No matter how many times I called her name, Mayuri did not answer.


Back then, Mayuri wouldn't talk to anyone. Not to me, not even to her parents.




</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Whenever I saw her standing there, staring at the sky, I felt unease grip my heart.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Her gaze was so earnest, her intentions so pure, that I feared some power might grant her wish, and carry her off to heaven to join her beloved grandmother.


And so, to ensure that nothing like that happened, I made sure to stop by the cemetery every day.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
I would stand next to the skygazing Mayuri, and call her name.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2747" mode="on">
"Mayuri?"

But no matter how many times I'd call her, Mayuri wouldn't reply.

The only sound in the lonely cemetery was the echo of my voice, calling her name.

It was raining that day, too.

Mayuri had a light blue umbrella.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
In contrast to the umbrella's color, the sky was glazed gray, covered in clouds.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
After a while, the rain stopped.

Rays of light shone through gaps in the clouds, a stunningly beautiful sight.


Rembrandt's Rays, they are called, or sometimes the Angel's Ladder.


Suddenly, a strong wind swept through the cemetery.

It caught Mayuri's umbrella and carried it into the sky.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0793" mode="on">
"..."

Mayuri seemed not to notice. She kept staring at the sky.


And then, slowly...


So very slowly...

She stretched her hand out to the sky.

As if to grasp the rays of light.

As if her grandmother were reaching down to pull her up.

And then, she lifted herself on her toes.

To me, it looked as if she were floating up towards heaven.



Impulsively, I grabbed Mayuri's outstretched hand and pulled her into my embrace.

In retrospect, my fears were just a childish fantasy, but at the time, I truly believed that Mayuri might vanish.

It was the first excuse that came to mind.

<PRE @box00>[text00141]
Before her grandmother died, Mayuri and I were fans of a popular TV series about costumed heroes battling evil.


I particularly admired the villain, a mad scientist. I even got pretty good at mimicking his lines.

Now I was doing it to hide my embarrassment.

I could feel my face growing red, but I kept up the mad scientist act all the same. If nothing else, it was better than admitting my insecurities.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2751" mode="on">

A terrible screech fills my head, like feedback from a giant speaker.

I'm in the lab, standing in front of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with my cellphone to my ear.



No, not the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Since headgear is attached to it, it's the Time Leap Machine.

It's hard to breathe.

The drops sliding down my forehead are annoying.


I try to wipe them away with the back of my right hand.

Something is off.

It's like my body and my mind aren't totally in sync with each other.

Almost as if this isn't really my body.

As if my nerves aren't communicating properly with my extremities.

I try blinking slowly.

This might just be my imagination.

Could this be exhaustion?

I try to move my hand again.

There is no disconnect this time.

I can't breathe.

Even though it's hot and humid, my body shivers.

I remember this feeling, too, from the dream.

Did I choose wrong?

Was I granted a second chance, only to let it go to waste?

A soft feeling against my fingers.

I look down to see Mayuri's hand holding mine. When I look up, I see worry written in her face.

I reflexively look towards the door.

It happens exactly as I remember.

Five men burst into the lab.

Their movements are swift and sure -- professional -- and each of them is carrying a gun.

They spread out just inside the door and aim their weapons at us.


I recognize each of them.

There's no denying it now.

I did leap through time. It was the future I remembered.

I was supposed to change this present, to stop the madness about to unfold.

But I told myself that it was a dream, and wasted my chance to save everyone.

A woman is coming up the stairs.

Kiryu Moeka.

That doesn't make sense.


I know she comes to the lab around 6:30.

No matter how slowly you walk, it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to get to the lab.

I take a bottle of Dr P out of the fridge and chug it down.

It's easy to forget, since she's usually here, but Mayuri and I rarely spend time together outside of the lab.

I kick Daru out of the lab and send him home.

He promised to call Kurisu for me and tell her to stay at her hotel, but a few minutes later, she calls me directly and demands an explanation. It takes some effort, but I manage to convince her to do as I say.

Now I just need to wait for Mayuri to get back.

I thought about looking for her, but it's too risky. We could miss each other like we did at the shrine. Better to wait here in front of the building.

While waiting, I try to convince myself that everything will be okay.

Mayuri returns to the lab at 6:30.

That leaves about an hour before Moeka's attack.

In an hour, we could ride the bullet train from Tokyo Station to Shizuoka.

Is that the best plan?

Maybe we should get off at Yokohama and lay low in a hotel for a while.

I can think about what comes next after Mayuri's safe.

The Time Leap Machine doesn't matter. Moeka can have it.


My top priority is to prevent Mayuri's death.

Sweat accumulates on my forehead and rolls down my face.

Hurry back, Mayuri.

During the attack, she took down five armed commandos in the blink of an eye.

I still can't believe it. Where does an 18-year-old girl learn to move like that?




And then there was her strange behavior immediately before the attack. She left as soon as she heard about the bomb threat, almost as if she knew something was going to happen.

I've got to get out of here.


I take a step. A sharp pain stabs through my body.

The crash must have broken a bone in my leg.

It doesn't matter. I have to get to the lab and time leap again.


That's the only way to save Mayuri.

I look back at the site of the accident.

Moeka is slowly regaining her feet, but Mayuri remains limp and motionless on the road.



It breaks my heart to leave Mayuri lying there, but I have no choice.



I have to go.

Fighting the pain of my broken leg, I manage to drag myself back to the lab.

Last time, we failed because we went to Akihabara Station.

I should have known that SERN would be watching.

This time, we'll take a taxi to another station, then hide somewhere until things calm down.

For now, all I can do is wait for Mayuri to return. It's driving me crazy.

I consider explaining the situation to Kurisu and Daru, but I just don't have the strength to do that right now.

If we wanted to, we could even leave from Akiba station.

But that seems like a bad idea. Moeka and her men might already be there.


We should board from another station.


If the plan is to head for Yokohama, the fastest way is to take the bullet train from Tokyo Station.

To get to Tokyo Station without passing through Akihabara Station means boarding at Kanda or Awajicho.

If we can make it to Yasukuni-dori, the station's right there.

But I freeze when I see a group of six men walking just ahead.

Are they Moeka's men?

I don't know, but we can't take the chance. I pull Mayuri into a nearby alley.

How many men does SERN have?

When did these patrols start?

Are they watching stations besides Akihabara?

I have no way of knowing.

To make matters worse, SERN's assassins are indistinguishable from ordinary shoppers at a glance. You can tell they're different when you get close, but by then it's too late.





They could be anyone. Japanese, foreigners, anyone.

I pull Mayuri into the entrance of a nearby building.

Several young men pass by. They're not particularly fit, and each of them is carrying a bag full of computer parts.


I don't think they're the enemy. But I can't be sure.

The only way to be safe is to treat every group of men as a potential threat.

At this rate, it'll be night before we escape Akiba.

Maybe we should just go for it and hope to get lucky.

I look up the closest station with my phone.

Ochanomizu and Suehirocho are about equidistant from our current position.

Suehirocho takes us near the lab, but Ochanomizu is on the same line as Akihabara. It might be affected by the bomb threat.

That's why she killed Mayuri first.

"Guh!"

A screeching fills my ears. Needles stab into my brain.

The shock lasts an instant, then the pain is gone.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00630]
A wave of nausea hits me. Vomit backflows into my mouth.

I swallow it back. My throat burns.

I leapt immediately after seeing the photo.

I couldn't accept it. Not even for a second.

In the 20 minutes I took my eyes off of Mayuri, she was captured by Moeka's men.

They took her to France and stuck her in the LHC.

They sent her through their unstable black hole 50 years into the past.


It wasn't an experiment. It was just a warning. A threat.

How could anyone do such a thing?

Now that I've recovered slightly from the shock, I realize that Mayuri was probably still alive when Moeka sent me that picture.

A flight to France takes at least twelve hours, after all.


Even so, her fate was already <I>decided</i>⑰.

Perhaps that 50-year-old newspaper article appeared out of thin air the instant they found her.

I don't know why her cause of death changed.

I don't have time to investigate.

The only choice is to run.

Our enemies don't consider Mayuri human.

I'm filled with rage.

I want to kill them.


I won't let them have her!

The clock shows 5:05 PM.

Not as much time left as I thought.

Come to think of it, the Time Leap Machine should be able to send me back to noon at least.

I'll do that next time.

A chill runs up my spine. What am I thinking?

Next time? Have I already given up on saving her this time?

I shake my head to clear it of negative thoughts.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
Judging by the time, Mayuri's already left the shrine.

So I can't contact her until she gets back to the lab.

All I can do is wait.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
As before, the Braun Tube Workshop closes early. Mayuri appears as Suzuha and Mister Braun are leaving.

We run through Kanda Myojin's back streets to Ochanomizu Station, taking only minimal precautions to avoid attracting attention. We have to get there before the Sobu Line shuts down.

We manage to make it to the station without being stopped, but when we get there, I see a group of men waiting by the entrance. They look like SERN.


Change of plans. We turn around and head for the Shin-Ochanomizu subway station.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
We arrive at the station later than I intended.

I don't usually come here, so I got lost.

I stare nervously at the platform clock.

According to the scrolling display, the Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines have already suspended operations.

Wait... it looks like the Chiyoda Line has too.



It must be protocol to assume that nearby stations may be threatened, even stations on unconnected lines. 

Damn!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
Mayuri hasn't said a word about my strange behavior.

This is the third time I've led her on this escape, but each time, she follows me without complaint.

Does she really trust me that much?

Maybe she can feel my desperation.



That's why I want so badly to save her.

We've been together for more than a decade. She's like a little sister to me.



I'll leap as many times as it takes.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0869" mode="on">

Mayuri tilts her head quizzically. I realize that I'm staring at her.

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Mayuri smiles happily at that answer.

That's right. While we wait for the train, I should ask Mayuri about her whereabouts today.

If -- <I>if</i>⑰ -- I have to leap again, I'll need all the information I can get.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2874" mode="on">

"Um, we met at the Starbecks at UPX."

So that's where she was.

Just then, an announcement plays over the PA system. The subway is resuming normal operations.

About 20 minutes have passed since we arrived.

I didn't expect to be stuck here that long, but it's okay.

Right now, Moeka should be in Akihabara, heading to the lab.

Everything is going to be alright.

While waiting for the train, I examine the route map on the station's noticeboard.

We can transfer to an overland train at Yoyogi-Uehara. It'll take a while, but that will take us all the way to Odawara.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Another announcement. Our train is arriving.

I can hear the rumbling and see the lights at the end of the tunnel.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Mayuri and I are standing just behind the white line.

I reach for her hand, meaning to make a dash for the train when the doors open, but I guess there's no hurry now. I let my hand fall to my side, empty.

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
There she is, leaning out over the tracks. She's off balance, as if she stumbled, or someone pushed her.

She seems to hang there for a moment, and then the train comes screaming into the station.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
I hear a <I>sound</i>⑰ from under the train. I can't describe it, but it makes me instantly nauseous.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
Sparks fly as the train slams on its brakes.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
The people on the platform scream.

I turn to where Mayuri was just a moment ago.

There stands a familiar girl.

Tiny, adorable, a cute black rabbit pouch slung over her shoulder.



Tennouji Nae.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
She looks up at me.

She stares at me for a few more seconds, as if waiting for me to say something, then turns and runs away.


The platform is in chaos. The PA informs us that there's been a 'personal injury accident.'

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
Nae is already gone. I don't go after her.

Instead, I peek timidly through the gap between the train and the platform.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00260]
One side of the track... is a wash of red.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00270]
My mind is blank.

I can't think.

I don't even remember how I got back to the lab.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
Moeka's group should have come and gone, but the Time Leap Machine is still here.

I guess I should be grateful.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00290]
It takes longer than usual to set up the machine. For some reason, I have trouble recalling my own phone number.

At last, it's ready.

Now... take me back.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
The leap occurs instantaneously.

Titor claimed that his time machine takes one hour of subjective time to travel ten years. I don't know if ours has the same behavior, but now is not the time to find out.

Ten years...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
I have no business that far back.

Besides, according to Kurisu, time leaping too far into the past could cause mental disorders due to the gap between personality and memory.

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0877" mode="on">
"Juicy Chicken Number One♪"

Mayuri is singing her chicken song, though she's actually eating precooked chicken from the convenience store, instead of her usual Juicy Chicken Number One.

She had to switch because she can't warm up frozen chicken in the microwave, which is now a dedicated part of the Time Leap Machine.

...I was right to come back five hours.

Mayuri is still in the lab.

But what the hell happened back there?

It hurts, but I force myself to recall that horrifying scene.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Mayuri died again.

This time, it happened at Shin-Ochanomizu Station, a place completely unrelated to the lab or the bomb threat.

Tennouji Nae pushed her onto the tracks, where the train tore her to shreds.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
Could Nae be working for SERN too?

No... No, that can't be right.

Nae has a habit of jumping on Mayuri in greeting. She was probably just being her usual affectionate self.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
But why did she choose that precise moment?

I don't know.

I sense malice.

Whose malice?

It's like fate is playing a cruel joke on us.

Whatever the case, all that matters now is that I have another chance. I need to act.

I have the power to save Mayuri. I will do whatever it takes to find a way.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
This time, we hail a taxi on Chuo-dori.

It'll be expensive, but that hardly matters now.

Mayuri comes along quietly.

I consider taking her home to Ikebukuro, but Moeka's group might be watching her house. I have no idea where they are at this point in time.

Instead, I ask the driver to take us to Shinagawa.

However...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
The traffic is unusually heavy.

The driver says it's never been this bad before.

There must be an obstruction up ahead -- an accident or something. That's the only explanation I can think of.

We've made it out of Akiba, but at this rate, it will take forever to reach Shinagawa.

I consider getting off here and taking the train, but then I remember what happened at Shin-Ochanomizu Station.

I have a bad feeling about this.

The traffic jam could be SERN's doing. I look out the window and scan the crowd for anyone who might be a SERN agent.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Three hours later, we're still stuck.


According to a conversation I overheard between our driver and another driver, there's some kind of inspection up ahead.

Furthermore, it doesn't seem to be a police inspection, and a small fight broke out at the inspection site or something.

To make matters worse, this road has already been closed off, and all the cars behind us are being detoured.

There are only about 100 cars waiting, but the inspection has been at a standstill for three hours.


This can't be a coincidence. Once again, I feel the malice of fate, manipulating the situation.



Is Mayuri going to die again?

If I'd known it was going to turn out like this, I'd have ditched the taxi hours ago.

It's not too late. I should pay the driver and get off right--


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Just then, someone knocks on the window.

Our taxi is stopped in the middle of the road. What's going on?

I look over, but before I can say anything, a man opens the rear door and gets in next to Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0878" mode="on">

He's holding a knife.

Another assassin!

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2877" mode="on">
"Mayuri, look out!"

Before she can reply, the man covers Mayuri's mouth with a large, meaty hand.

I try to open my door, but it's locked. Only the driver can open it from the inside.

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0879" mode="on">

Another man gets into the passenger seat.

He points a gun at the driver and says something to him.

Strength drains from Mayuri's body.

Her eyes slowly close.

A tear rolls down her cheek.

I watch her die inches away, powerless to stop it.

I can feel her last breath against my skin.

They killed her again.

Why?

Why!?

Why can't I save her!?

Why won't you let me save her!?

Who decided that Mayuri must die!?

Moeka? SERN?

Or--

Does the world itself wish for Mayuri's death?

I won't accept that!

I clench my jaw and throw myself forward, driving my forehead into the killer's nose.


<voice name="Man　Who　Stabbed　Mayuri" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/RND_0001" mode="on">

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
I crawl out of the taxi and take off running through the traffic jam.

After running for hours, I make it back to the lab. Luckily, the Time Leap Machine is still there.

I have to leap again.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
Every time we run, Mayuri dies.

Six hours into the past, I clutch my head and wrack my brain for an answer.

I feel like I've hit a dead end.


What do I do if we can't run away?

Is there no way to save her?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2881" mode="on">
"No! There has to be a way!"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]

"Whatcha talking about?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
Mayuri's blank stare is the only answer I get.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
This time, I take her to the closest police station and beg them to protect her.


When asked why, I explain that someone is going to kill Mayuri six hours from now, but without any proof that there's someone after her, they have no choice but to turn us away. 

It's past six by the time we leave the station, and we're left with no choice but to keep running.

I wish that I could blame my previous failures on bad luck. We could try Ochanomizu or Shinbashi again, and maybe this time she won't die.


But I don't have the courage to try those routes again. At the same time, we can't stay in Akiba.

We're running out of options.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
Subways, trains, and taxis -- all out.

Attempting escape by those means will get Mayuri killed. So my heart tells me.

Perhaps the fear is irrational, but I can't put it out of my mind.


I've seen her die a half-dozen times already -- shot, stabbed, torn to pieces.

I can't go through that again.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
We take refuge in Yodobashi Camera.

I thought we could keep hiding there indefinitely, but just after 7, we hear an explosion in front of the station.



Yodobashi goes into chaos.

Policemen appear and start evacuating the store.

When I try to explain our situation, an officer shouts "terrorist!" and pulls his gun.

This can't be happening.

This isn't America.

Japanese police officers don't shoot without provocation.


Mayuri dies.

It happens so fast.

The policeman shoots her right in the head.

I don't know if he was real policeman or a SERN assassin in disguise. It doesn't matter.

I can't deny it any longer.

The world itself is killing Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
This time, I don't leap into action immediately. Instead, I sit on the couch and collect my thoughts.

Every time I try to save Mayuri, it ends in the worst possible way.

To make matters worse, I no longer even know what I'm supposed to be saving her <I>from</i>⑰.

Cause and effect.

Why does Mayuri die?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
At first, I thought that it was Moeka and her hit squad, sent by SERN to steal our time machine.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
But as I leapt back in time again and again, the cause of Mayuri's death kept changing.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
At Shin-Ochanomizu Station, she died because Nae pushed her off the platform.

SERN had nothing to do with that. It was an accident.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
Each time I leap, she dies a different way.


What does that mean?

I've been thinking for an hour, and I'm no closer to an answer.

I want someone to tell me, but who can I ask?

I'm the only person in history to leap through time.

...No, there's one more. John Titor.

But he's not replying to my emails anymore, and he hasn't posted on @channel in days.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
I'm not even convinced he's a real time traveler.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
I decide not to run this time.

Instead, I take a different approach. Strike first.


I send Moeka an email.

"I need to talk to you about our time machine. Meet me alone."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
I designate the roof of Radio Kaikan as our meeting place.

Two weeks have passed since the satellite crashed, but it's still there and the building's still closed.



At least the security has lessened, so it's easy for me to sneak in.


Not that there's any sneaking to do. I just walk in through the front door like I belong there. No one questions me.

Last time I came here was for Doctor Nakabachi's presentation.

Of course, on this worldline, the presentation was canceled.

Naturally, there's nobody here but me.

It occurs to me that this is a dangerous gambit. Moeka might have a gun, and I already know that she's willing to use it.


But then, I don't intend to play fair either.

We're supposed to meet at 5:30. It's just after 5.

I came early in order to ambush her.

I hide in the shadows and wait with bated breath.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
About thirty minutes later, I hear the door open.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Moeka makes her entrance, alone.

She looks around restlessly.

She still hasn't noticed me.

I take a gun out of my shirt.

It's not real.

It's Future Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun.

It's just a toy raygun with a remote control attached. Obviously a bluff, but all I could prepare on such short notice.





</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
I run up behind Moeka and shove the Bit Particle Gun into her back.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2882" mode="on">

After Moeka raises her hands, I feel through her clothes.

Sure enough, she's carrying a gun.

I take it from her and press it to Moeka's back in place of the Bit Particle Gun.

What time is it?

How long have I been unconscious?

There's a man with me inside the car.

I recognize him from a previous time leap. He's the one who stabbed Mayuri in the taxi.


The man seems to notice I've woken up, but he doesn't speak.

He just waves his gun menacingly, as if to say that there's no hope of escape.



The dashboard clock reads 7:30.

I look out the window again.

Through the film, I manage to make out a street sign.

We're close to the lab.

Has the attack already happened?

Before I left, I told everyone, including Mayuri, to run.

If she did as I said, she won't die by their hands.

But that doesn't mean she's safe.

If I don't do something, Moeka's going to take the Time Leap Machine away.

What will happen then?

SERN can have the machine, if it will save Mayuri.

The problem is that it won't, not when the world itself is determined to kill her.

As long as the Time Leap Machine remains in my hands, I can keep trying to fix things.

I'll leap again and again until I find a way to save her.

But if I lose the machine, then the future is decided.

A future without Mayuri.

I have to get to it before they do, even if that means I might get shot.

As long as I survive to reach the Time Leap Machine, everything will be alright.

If time is a straight line, then it's likely that the present will be reconstructed based on my actions in the past.

What is she trying to do?

What is that satellite?

How is it related to John Titor?

Is it even a satellite? Nobody knows for sure.

I checked online. No satellites fell out of orbit that day.

When they do, whether by accident or design, they usually burn up in the atmosphere.

It's impossible for one to land in such perfect condition.

So what is it, then?

A jolt suddenly runs through my body.

Could it be... a time machine!?

There's only one way to know for sure.

I need to get there before Suzuha does something!

The elevator and escalator aren't operating, so I bound up the stairs two at a time.

My lungs gasp and my legs burn, but I force my body to carry me to the top.

There's the satellite, lodged in Radio Kaikan's roof. I notice wires holding it in place. The police must have done that so it wouldn't fall.


There's a hatch open on the side of the machine. I see someone moving inside.




<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3024" mode="on">

The person freezes when I shout.

Suzuha turns to me with a sad expression.

Behind her, I can see the interior of the satellite.

It's surprisingly simple, without the switches and buttons you'd expect.


Instead, there's a black box the size of a desktop PC. There are numbers on the screen -- "2010.08.13," and below that, "1975.08.13."

Suzuha reaches out to press a button.

Suzuha doesn't look at Kurisu.

She still seems to have a grudge against her.

Kurisu would never actively cooperate with SERN. I know that, but I just can't say it in front of Suzuha.

For some reason, Suzuha really does see Kurisu as responsible for the problems of the future.

But if that's the case, why doesn't Suzuha just kill Kurisu? Wouldn't that change the future too?

Maybe she can't.

Worldlines converge.

We're searching for something with the same cryptic logo as this mysterious pin.

Honestly, I didn't think it would be this difficult.

Akiba has plenty of niche stores, but they're all for electronic goods and PC parts. There aren't that many selling accessories like Suzuha's pin.

We check every one we can find, but come up empty-handed. None of the store employees have any idea where it came from either.


We even check nearby neighborhoods like Ueno and Asakusa. Nothing.

Based on recommendations from the BBS thread, I spend the morning visiting stores in Akiba.




My destinations run the gamut from otaku stores packed with anime goods to souvenir shops full of Olympic memorabilia. I even visit a few that specialize in locally-manufactured goods.

But although I hit just about every kind of store that could be considered niche, I am unable to find anything that resembles Suzuha's pin.


Maybe I should go all the way to Ikebukuro or Nakano.

I start heading back to the lab, but just then, a street vendor catches my eye.

It's not like I have anything to lose, so I walk over and check out the selection. Among the various accessories, I see a number of metal pins.

What a coincidence. Could he have a pin like Suzuha's?

I don't see the "OSHM＊＊＊A 7010" logo on any of the displayed accessories, but I'd better ask just to be sure.

Umm... he's a foreigner... so maybe I should use English?

So in the future, no one is allowed to leave Japan?

Japan was like that a few centuries ago too, when the Tokugawa shogunate closed the country to the west.

It sounds like SERN set international relations back hundreds of years.

Perhaps that's why there's no war in Suzuha's time. It's hard for conflicts to emerge when races and cultures can't interact.

It sounds kind of like a prison with invisible walls, guarded by SERN and the Committee of 300.

It's the night of the 11th. I went back about 40 hours.

My objective is to keep watch on the street vendor's stand in the hope that Suzuha's father might appear.

I sent Suzuha elsewhere. I don't want her to be disappointed if I come up empty-handed.


I'm standing out of sight a short distance away from the stand, munching on energy bars and soy milk to appease my growling stomach.


I've already been here for two hours.

I forgot to ask for the exact time the suspicious character appeared, so I had to begin my stakeout before sunset.

Now it's 8 PM and the stand looks like it's about to close.


Is this another waste of time?

Did that foreigner give me false information?

I was wrong.

Forget about 2036. She can't even return here, to 2010. Not without living 35 years.



She'll be 54 when 2010 comes around. The "present" us and the "present" Suzuha can never meet again.


Suzuha chose this mission.

To change the future. To save Mayuri.



Unless Suzuha travels to 1975, Mayuri will die.

But then, what about Suzuha herself?

When she leaves for 1975, she'll have to sacrifice everything she has here.

Should I let Suzuha leave like this?

Suzuha isn't from this time. If she doesn't want to stay, then I have no reason to keep her from leaving

Suzuha finishes securing her bicycle and turns to us with a soft smile.

It's not the painful, forced smile I saw yesterday.

We don't perform a startup test. Activating the time machine would draw too much attention.

Suzuha's mind is set. I know that nothing I can say will convince her to stay.

So why am I trying to stop her?

"Change the future. Please."

Nobody speaks. Nobody nods. 

We don't have the words.

But she sees it in our faces.

Resolve.

Suzuha has entrusted us with her will and her mission. We meet her gaze, each of us, and silently swear to protect them to the end.

The future Suzuha came from is not the future we desire.


In Suzuha's time, Daru and I fought to change it.

This time, we'll make sure it never happens.

Mayuri will live. Kurisu will be free.

Suzuha will grow up knowing her father.

We must change the future, that all these things may come to pass.

<PRE @box00>[text00750]
With that final warning, Suzuha boards the time machine. She waves once, and then the hatch closes behind her.

Moments later, the machine comes to life.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00760]
A shrill alarm starts ringing.


There are no other sounds. It makes less noise than I'd expect.

People on the street below start shouting and cheering at the satellite's sudden activity. They all look up and point.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00770]
My phone vibrates. I quickly take it out and open it. The mail is from Suzuha.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00780]
Goodbye...

When I failed to stop her on a previous worldline, she sent me the exact same message before leaving.

But this time, the word holds a completely different meaning.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00790]
I lift my eyes from the message to see the space around the time machine begin to warp.

A cocoon of light appears and envelops the fuselage.

I squint my eyes against the brilliance.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3280" mode="on">
"Suzuha..."

We will never see her again. Not this Suzuha.

Yes, we can seek her out in our time. I know that I will make the effort.


But the next time we meet, an immense gulf of time will have divided us.

No matter how hard we wish it were different, she will not be the girl we knew.




All of a sudden, Daru takes a step into the light.

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1002" mode="on">
"S-Suzuha!!"

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1003" mode="on">
"I'm sure we'll meet again!"

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1004" mode="on">

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1005" mode="on">
"I'll do my best, I promise! So Suzuha, do your best too!"

His words probably can't reach her anymore.

As the light grows more intense, I raise my hand to shield my eyes.

Bathed in radiant particles, the cocoon slowly, slowly unfurls.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00800]
The next thing I know, Suzuha's time machine has vanished into thin air, leaving a hole the size of a dump truck in Radio Kaikan's wall.


The air is thick with the smell of ozone, and seems to pulse softly where the machine stood.


We stand there for a while, staring silently at the empty spot while the summer breeze blows gently past.

As if the wind were fate itself.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
Unfortunately, we don't have time to mourn her departure.

In about an hour and a half, Moeka's group will attack the lab.

Before that happens, we need to acquire the IBN 5100 that Suzuha went to 1975 to obtain.

The time machine's sudden disappearance has thrown the area into chaos, which makes it easy for us to slip out unnoticed.

"See you in 35 years," Suzuha said.

54-year-old Suzuha should be here in Akiba. Before she left, we decided that the time machine's disappearance would be her cue to bring the IBN 5100 to the lab.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
But when we return to the lab, there's no 54-year-old woman waiting for us.

It seems Suzuha hasn't come yet.

As I check the lab for any sign of Suzuha, a line of red numbers catches my eye.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
The meter reads 0.337187%.

...Divergence hasn't changed.

Reading Steiner didn't activate this time, so I suspected that might be the case.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
Let's think this through.

I thought that divergence would change the instant Suzuha obtained an IBN 5100 in 1975.

But maybe there's something else that needs to happen.

Will it change the instant Suzuha hands me the IBN 5100?

Or will it change when we use the IBN 5100 to delete my email from SERN's database?

At any rate, all we can do now is wait for Suzuha to arrive.

The divergence meter still reads 0.337187%. It hasn't changed since before Suzuha left.

What went wrong?

I can't go back 10 years with the Time Leap Machine.

I can't do anything about Suzuha's death.

Should I have stopped her from leaving after all?

Maybe then this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00930]
No. What choice did I have?


I can't save Mayuri without the IBN 5100. Suzuha had to travel to 1975.

I consider my options.

What if I redo these two days again? Could Daru fix the time machine so this doesn't happen?

Is fixing the time machine even possible?

Daru's skills are second to none, and the time machine was built by his own hand, 26 years in the future.

It seems logical that he would be able to fix it.


But look at it another way.

It took Daru <I>twenty-six years</i>⑰ to learn enough to build the time machine, and he had to reverse-engineer SERN's to do it.


Maybe it's unreasonable to expect our Daru to perform flawless repairs in only two days.

In that case, can I have Daru use the Time Leap Machine and repeat these two days until he repairs it?

No. He'll have to start from scratch each time. Two days just aren't enough.

On the original worldline, Suzuha leapt to 1975 after failing to meet her father.

Unsatisfied with that outcome, I sent a D-Mail to convince myself to follow Suzuha and prevent her from leaving.



As a result, she remained in 2010 for an additional four days.

But that night, the time machine was damaged by a thunderstorm.

If I hadn't followed Suzuha that day...

If I hadn't sent that D-Mail to myself...

Her time machine would not have malfunctioned.

She would have arrived safely in 1975.

The solution is obvious. I need to cancel that D-Mail.

Leading the way at a terrific pace is Suzuha on her trusty mountain bike.

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0777" mode="on">
"What a view!"

From here, you can see across Tokyo Bay, all the way to Rainbow Bridge in the distance.


Akiba and the jumbled sprawl of central Tokyo are two hours ride behind us. Here on this artificial island there are only skyscrapers and vacant lots -- one extreme or the other.


One time, I took the bus back to Akiba after ComiMa, so I already knew how close it was. But I never thought I'd come here by bike.

Except for Suzuha, we're all using rent-a-cycles.

I wanted a change of pace from the search for the unfindable pin, so I proposed this cycling expedition.

Of course, I already know who the pin belongs to, and who Suzuha's father is.

But I have chosen not to tell anyone.

If at all possible, I want to spend these two days in peace, and delay Suzuha's time travel.

That is my goal now.

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0778" mode="on">
"I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!"

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2018" mode="on">

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1015" mode="on">

"You two are all worn out! Ehehe!"

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0779" mode="on">
"Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!"

Kurisu and Daru are exhausted, while Suzuha and Mayuri are still going strong.

I already know the distance between Akiba and Ariake, so I'm able to pace myself in order to conserve energy.

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1016" mode="on">
"W-water! Where's a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3308" mode="on">

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1017" mode="on">
"Y-you serious? I can't, it's impossible..."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1032" mode="on">
"Wow, Okarin. You really know the area. Have you been here before?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3309" mode="on">
"...Yeah. Many times."


How long have I been living in this closed loop of time?

It's already getting hard to keep track of the days, so instead I think in two-day cycles.


This should be the fourth cycle.


This time, only I know that Mayuri is fated to die.

By keeping that secret, I allow us to spend these days like normal kids our age would.

This cycling expedition is part of that.

Suzuha and Mayuri enjoy the ride, so I make sure we do it each time I repeat the loop. 

Our current destination is Tokyo Big Sight, the massive convention center in Ariake.

In a few days, it will be home to ComiMa, the world's largest doujinshi marketplace event.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3310" mode="on">
"Big Sight's straight ahead. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get there."

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1018" mode="on">
"Let's take a break first..."

Daru has used up the last of his strength. While still on his bike, he rests his body against the guardrail separating us from the road.

I turn and pull up next to Daru's bike.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3311" mode="on">
"It's not safe there. Come on."

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1019" mode="on">
"Let me rest!"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3312" mode="on">

<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_1020" mode="on">
"Okay, okay!"

Daru stands up.

Mayuri's innocent smile.

Kurisu's cynical grin.

To them, it's a joke, but they're not mistaken.



The only thing they got wrong was that I didn't send a D-Mail. I time leaped.

Will the girls scream, I wonder?

Let's find out.

What difference does it make if Daru dies? I can just time leap again, can't I?

Go back to the start of the loop, and Daru will be as good as new.


Besides, everyone needs a little spice in their life.

Getting her alone would be simple enough.

All I have to do is offer information on her father and she'll follow me anywhere.

To make matters easier, no Amane Suzuha exists in present-day Japan.

No documents proving Japanese citizenship. Not even a birth certificate.

It's only natural. She won't be born for another seven years.

So even if she runs to the police, nobody will believe a word she says.

I imagine she'll put up a fight. She was a member of the Resistance in her time, and I know she's stronger than she looks.

But she's still just a girl. It may take some doing, but I'll have my way with her in the end.

My hands still move.

Just as I expect them to.

Just as I order them to.

But.

Those dark impulses.

The devil's whispers.

How can I explain those?

What the hell was that?

What's happening to me?

I start to tremble.

My teeth chatter.


The sun's hot enough to burn my skin, but I feel cold.

I'm afraid of myself.

I'm... still okay, aren't I?

I am Hououin Kyouma. Okabe Rintaro.

The insane mad scientist with a fetish for science and chaos.

See? I still know who I am.

Like a Moebius Strip, the same two days go round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round.

But today, I failed to keep them the same.

My feelings became twisted.

Today on Harumi Bridge, I didn't just hesitate to save Daru. I nearly yielded to my dark emotions.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00550]
Dark emotions.

Dark impulses.

Emotions seeping with venom.

I listened to their poisonous, disgusting whispers.

And I was almost drawn in.

There's no denying it.

Worse, that was but a taste of what might lurk inside my heart.

If those emotions attack me again, this time crashing over me like a tsunami...


Will I be able to control myself?

I don't know.

That answer is hardly reassuring.

But for now, it's the only answer I've got.

This endless loop is the world I wished for.

I can only protect this world. Only I can protect this world.

I pray that those impulses were just a fluke, that they'll never resurface again.


I ask only that tomorrow be peaceful.

The wind caresses my cheek.

I push down on the pedals and begin the ascent up Harumi Bridge.

The spokes revolve rhythmically, reflecting the sunlight.

Sweat oozes out of every pore, but it's not unpleasant.

Hundreds of days have passed since this began. Maybe thousands. How many cycles has it been?

I've repeated this loop so many times that I've grown tired of keeping track.

I can barely remember the reason I started.

The days go by, like tearing pages from a calendar.

Everyone says the same things. Everyone responds in the same way. I've noticed my biorhythms seem a bit off, but aside from that, every day is the same.

Same, same, same, same, same, same, same, same.

Yes, subtle deviations occur.

But it's all within acceptable limits. In the end, the result is always the same.

Everything that happens is insignificant. Meaningless. Pointless.


I'm the only one still living in this loop.

Everyone else is just being kept alive.

By me.

We're just spinning our wheels in a dead world.

My soul died some cycles back. I don't remember.


This isn't life.

Mayuri's death?

Moeka's raid?

Suzuha's time travel?

I may have cared about those things once.

Not anymore.

When did I stop caring?

When did I become a machine, looping and looping for all eternity?

Nothing matters.

When these two days are over, they will start again. Everything will be reset. I will reset it myself.

Then I guess it's pointless to worry.

Ridiculous.

How many times have I repeated this loop?

My senses have gone dull. It's getting harder to respond to the things I see and hear.

I feel detached. Like I'm isolated inside a thin membrane.

And I've already gotten used to it.

I don't find it inconvenient anymore.

I simply adapted.

I simply optimized.

To this far too narrow world.

To this far too gentle world.

Why shouldn't I adapt?

This is my world.

While Daru was repairing the time machine, I let my mind rest.

I avoided all contact, slept like a log, and tried to piece my soul back together.

Cold sweat oozes from my temples.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3381" mode="on">
"It's gone..."

I checked the meter a few minutes ago, just before the worldline changed. Now it's nowhere to be found.

I quickly realize what has happened.

Suzuha gave me the meter after we stopped her from leaving. My D-Mail undid those events.

Of course the meter isn't here.

A surge of regret seizes my heart. I clench my teeth and endure it as best I can.


If nobody else remembers, then I alone will keep these memories of Suzuha alive.



I look around the room.

Mayuri and Kurisu are on the sofa, dozing on each other's shoulders.

Daru, oblivious to the vulnerable high school girls behind him, is playing an eroge on his computer.

I take a deep breath and turn on the TV.

I flip to a news channel.

The worldline should have changed.

I erased the time we spent with Suzuha.

That should have allowed her to leap to 1975 without losing her memories, and the IBN 5100 should be in our hands now.

We can use it to hack into SERN and erase the data they intercepted from us.

Without that information, Moeka's men won't attack the lab. Mayuri won't have to die.

That's how it should be.

That's how it has to be.

Otherwise, why did I sacrifice Suzuha's dream?

The quickest way to confirm the change would be to check for any delays at Akihabara Station.

I head back there to search for it.

But contrary to my expectations, I can't find it anywhere.

What's going on?

I look at my watch. It's 7:43 PM.


Moeka's men attack at... what time again?


My heart is pounding like a drum.

That D-Mail was supposed to fix everything. The trains are moving as scheduled, which means that Moeka's men aren't about to attack.

So why does it feel like nothing's fixed at all?

The IBN 5100's absence is extremely disturbing.

I want to sit down and think about where it could have gone, but a voice in my head is screaming that there's no time.

I need to calm down.

It's hard to think straight after everything that's happened.

I check my watch again. 7:46 PM.


Images from the assault flash through my mind.

Mayuri bleeding to death on the floor.

The smell of gunpowder in the air.

I frantically shake the visions out of my head.

I look towards the lab entrance.

The door has yet to be kicked in by a team of hitmen.

I swallow hard, petrified with terror.


Please, don't let anything happen.

And not a suspicious figure in sight.

The raid was before 8, if I remember correctly.

I think it's safe to say that my changes to the past have prevented it from occurring.

Mayuri and I are taking the Yamanote Line to Ikebukuro, so we part at the station's ticket gate.

This old one-story house is where Suzuha once lived.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00300]
Suzuha's bicycle!

For a moment, I can see her there, squatting beside the bicycle.

But the mountain bike Suzuha rode to the Braun Tube Workshop was shiny and new. Now it's old and covered in rust.


<voice name="Tennouji" class="VID_TEN" src="voice/TEN_0129" mode="on">
"Suzu-san loved that old thing."

<voice name="Tennouji" class="VID_TEN" src="voice/TEN_0130" mode="on">

"It's been sitting there for ten years. Couldn't throw it away. I've maintained it best I could, but I guess nothing lasts forever."

I gently put my hand on the seat.

It's warm from sitting out in the sun.

I suppose that, for the few days Suzuha was in Akiba, this bicycle existed in two places at the same time.

 A wave of nausea hits me as I recall what Nae did at Ochanomizu Station.

But I tell myself that was just an accident.

Besides, that incident has already been undone.

Tennouji Nae has done nothing wrong.

Next to the living room is a child's room.

There's a child's study desk and a red backpack on the floor.

Nae isn't here.

Which reminds me. Tennouji's daughter visits the workshop often, but not once have I seen his wife.

He couldn't have married Suzuha, could he?

I mean, she should have been a lot older than him when they met.

...But as they say, love knows no bounds.

Hmmmm... I wonder what really happened.

I don't know how I'd feel if those two were married.

That would make Daru Tennouji's father-in-law.

...Actually, that would be kind of interesting.

I turn to the Buddhist altar to pay my respects to Suzuha.

There's no picture of her, so there's no way to know what Hashida Suzu looked like at the age of 44.

I make an offering of incense to her, then look around the house again.

This is the house Suzuha lived in after leaping to 1975...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
I leave the lab and sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop.

Let's go over the plan.

Cancel all the D-Mails that have changed the past so far.

Of course, that includes D-Mails sent by people other than me.

Specifically, I'm only concerned with the D-Mails that triggered Reading Steiner.

We sent several of them as experiments.

For example, Operation Urd Stage Two, the LOTO SIX experiment, involved one such D-Mail.

But the real problem is what other people sent.

Mayuri and Kurisu haven't sent any D-Mails.

Daru sent his past self a strategy to win the Faris Cup, but Reading Steiner didn't activate, so divergence must not have changed.

That leaves three D-Mails to deal with -- those sent by Moeka, Lukako, and Faris.


The most problematic is the one Faris sent, which is also the most recent. I have no idea what it said, so I don't know how to cancel it.


Faris's D-Mail caused a dramatic change to Akiba.

All of the moe stores disappeared.

That's my only hint.

I'm the only one who remembers how things were before the change, so I won't get an answer from Faris, even if I ask her directly.

But still, I have to at least try.

I'll write Faris a mail.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Just give it to her straight.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
I send it.

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
Afterwards, I sit and stare at the screen, waiting.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
I've already tried sending three mails and calling four or five times, but 30 minutes pass without a single response.

Unable to hide my frustration, I storm off towards Faris's apartment.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
I arrive at the tall apartment building soaked in sweat.

I've been running an awful lot lately. It's made me realize how out of shape I am.

I wish I worked out more.

This complex has an automatic lock, so I have to call up from the lobby intercom.

I enter the number for Faris's apartment, and a man's calm voice soon replies.

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0001" mode="on">
"May I ask who's calling?"

Judging by the voice, it's not Faris's dad, but her butler.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3461" mode="on">
"Um, my name's Okabe."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3462" mode="on">
"I'd like to speak with Fari... I mean Rumiho-san."

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0002" mode="on">
"I regret to inform you that the young mistress is currently out."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3463" mode="on">
"Then where is she now?"

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0003" mode="on">
"I'm afraid I cannot answer that. You may be someone with whom she does not wish to interact."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3464" mode="on">
"I've been here before, remember!?"

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0004" mode="on">
"Of course, sir. However, I still cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact her directly."

He's obviously trying to end the conversation, so I panic to get the last word in.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3465" mode="on">
"P-please wait! I've been trying to get in touch with Faris, but she's not returning my calls or emails!"

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0005" mode="on">
"Then please try again some other time."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3466" mode="on">
"Guh!"

Frustrated by this new turn of events, my anger threatens to boil over.

Damn inflexible geezer!

I leave the lobby.

At 4:00, tons of people spew out of the building.

They're mostly parents with children, but there are also men and women in their 20s and 30s.

Something smashes into my forehead. Stars explode behind my eyes.

It's hot above my brow, as if a branding iron was pressed to it.

But that quickly fades to a dull throbbing.

Afterwards, I go to the assembly hall and ask the staff about Faris. No luck.

When I try calling Daru again, he says "Maybe she went home already?" in a bummed-out voice.

<PRE @box00>[text00530]
I return to Faris's apartment building and ring the intercom again. The butler responds once more.

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0006" mode="on">

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3484" mode="on">

It sounds like she's home.

The intercom goes silent for a while.

<PRE @box00>[text00540]
And then, the door's automatic lock opens, allowing me inside the elevator hall.

<voice name="Butler" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STJ_0008" mode="on">

I give him my thanks and hurry into the elevator.

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
The butler guides me into the bedroom, where Faris is sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees.

She doesn't look up, even when I approach.

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0188" mode="on">

What is she saying?

No, wait.

I think I get it.

I recall what happened after Faris's final match in the RaiNet championship.

That leather-clad asshole called her the former champ.

I guess that means she lost. And that's why she's depressed.

"Ah, no, I'm sorry."

Tears emerge from the corners of her eyes.

I have no idea what to do in this situation.

Judging by her tears, I don't think she's lying.

But there's really no basis to the theory that she'll remember if she wins the RaiNet tournament.

I'll try anything that could possibly yield results.

As long as I keep doing that, I'll find a solution eventually.

It has yet to fail once so far, but my luck might not last forever.


Suzuha lost her memory after traveling in a broken time machine.

Her time machine was different, of course, but something similar could happen with the Time Leap Machine.

Considering the Time Leap Machine's low budget and rushed schedule, it wouldn't be surprising if it broke somehow.


And there's one more thing.

I shouldn't allow anyone else to change the past.


My goal is to return to the worldline with the IBN 5100, then use it to escape from the Alpha Attractor Field.

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
There's still half an hour before the tournament begins, but there's already a line outside of UPX.

I didn't think there would be many participants since it's already the finals, but it turns out there's another tournament for the general public at the same time.

The opening act, so to speak.

The participants enter the hall through a different entrance than the spectators.

I'm at the participant entrance, waiting for Faris to make her appearance.

All cards on the board are face down, but each player is allowed to peek at his or her own cards.

<PRE @box00>[text00710]
The cameras are oriented in a way that the audience can't see what cards they have.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00720]
According to Daru, RaiNet AccessBattlers is a game of psychological warfare. It's all about figuring out where your opponent has placed his cards.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00730]
Each player starts with four Link Cards and four Virus Cards, for a total of eight cards face down on the board.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00740]
The victory conditions are a little complex, but in short, you win if you take four of your opponent's Link Cards or if you make your opponent take four of your Virus Cards.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00750]
The game starts with each player trying to figure out how the other has placed his or her cards.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00760]
Knowing your opponent's layout lets you shift the game to your advantage.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00770]
That's why it's important to be careful what moves you make, whether you're attacking or defending.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00780]
Your Duel Partner's there to make it harder for your opponent to read your thoughts.

Oddly enough, Faris makes the first move.

I ignore Daru and begin wading through the sea of spectators in search of my target.

Meanwhile, the game is still proceeding.

<PRE @box00>[text01070]
Faris takes the card she used for her first attack, and instead of sending it into enemy territory for another attack, pulls it back to fortify her defenses.

The Virals respond by unleashing a massive assault on her line.

They equip a card with Line Boost -- which allows it to move twice -- move it twice, and then unequip it. Then they equip Line Boost to another card and move that.

It looks like their strategy is to attack in waves. They even seem willing to make sacrifices, to a certain extent.



And of course, the Virals are most likely attacking with a mix of both Link Cards and Virus Cards.

In order to survive the onslaught, Faris is forced to capture some of their cards in retaliation. But each Virus Card she's tricked into taking puts her at even more of a disadvantage.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01080]
Faris looks very unsettled by 4℃'s unpleasant smile. The laser attacks must really be getting to her as well.

And finally, she makes a careless move that truly seems desperate.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01090]
Disbelief spreads through the hall.

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0037" mode="on">
"Hey hey hey!"

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0038" mode="on">

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0039" mode="on">
"Who would've thought the champion would make such an amateurish move?"

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0260" mode="on">
"..."

Amateurish?

I was too busy searching for the Viral underlings in the audience to pay attention to the match, but this new turn of events causes me to look up to the monitor.

Faris has moved one of her pieces to the other side of the board, the entrance to the Viral Attackers' server.



But the Virals must have used their Virus Checker card, because Faris's card is face up. It's a Virus Card.

Every card you send into the enemy Server is added to your total. Normally, you try to get Link Cards through, as that brings you closer to victory.

However, you're not required to reveal any cards you successfully send into your enemy's Server. So although it hurts your point total, you technically can send Virus Cards into your enemy's Server.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01100]
But for some strange reason, Faris is trying to send a <I>revealed</i>⑰ Virus Card into her enemy's server.

Even if it gets through, she won't be fooling anyone.

Moreover, Faris has already taken three Virus Cards. One more, and she'll lose. So she can't send that card through even if she wants to.


So what exactly was she trying to accomplish?

Is she really that distracted by the laser beam?

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0040" mode="on">
"Allow this elegant evil storyteller, 4℃, to make a jet black proclamation."

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0041" mode="on">
"In just a few minutes, you'll be demoted to <i>Former</i>⑰ Champion!"

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0042" mode="on">
"Hahahaha!"

Someone in the audience echoes 4℃'s vulgar laughter.

So that's where his underlings are!

I push my way through the audience in the direction of the laughter.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01110]
The rest of the audience starts booing.

I guess most RaiNetters really do hate the Virals.

But Faris herself doesn't respond to 4℃'s taunts.

She just bites her lip and closes her eyes.

Come on! Just put on the sunglasses!

This cute-things-only policy of hers is going to cost her the match.

Or maybe...

Maybe it's impossible to prevent Faris from losing.

Maybe convergence will bring about the same result, just as Mayuri is doomed to die no matter what I change.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01120]
The audience gasps.

The Virals have snatched a Link Card from Faris.

Now they have a total of two Link Cards.

I can feel it. Faris is losing.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01130]
But just then, I catch sight of a few guys dressed in all black.

One of them is surreptitiously aiming a pen-shaped object at the stage.

It's him!

I grab his wrist.

<voice name="Viral Attacker C" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/VFC_0000" mode="on">
"Wh-who are you!?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3566" mode="on">
"That's as far as you go. I won't let you interfere with Faris's match!"

<voice name="Viral Attacker C" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/VFC_0001" mode="on">
"Why you!"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3567" mode="on">
"Move and I shoot!"

<voice name="Viral Attacker C" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/VFC_0002" mode="on">
"...!?"

I thrust something into his side. It's Future Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun.

I remembered how this bluff worked with Moeka on a previous worldline, so I brought it just in case.

The man freezes. I guess he didn't expect to be held at gunpoint at a children's card game event.

Taking advantage of his surprise, I snatch the laser pointer out of his hand, then disappear back into the crowd.


The punk starts shouting, but gives up when he can't find me.

Good. That takes care of the laser.

Now Faris can focus on the game!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01140]
A scream goes up from the audience.

4℃ has snatched another one of Faris's Link Cards.

That's the third one. The Virals need just one more to win.

"All of your fans are just otakus who wanna do you. Does it really make you that happy to to have a fanbase filled with people like that?"

Faris still doesn't respond.

She hasn't said a word since the match started.

But I got rid of the interference, so Faris should come up with a reversal any second now.

I stare at her, praying for a miracle.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01160]
And when I do, Faris once again turns her face away, as if trying to avoid something.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3568" mode="on">
"What!?"

Is it another laser!?

<PRE @box00>[text01170]
The audience begins to murmur.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01180]
If Faris does have that kind of power, then it's no wonder she's so good at RaiNet.

My chuunibyou imagination starts to run wild, but I try my best to keep it suppressed.

If Faris really can see through lies, it would explain why she hated the laser beam attacks so much.



It would also explain why her moves made so little sense this match.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3569" mode="on">

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0262" mode="on">
"...I use Change Directory. Nya."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01210]
Change Directory is a special type of card called a "Terminal Card".

Once per game, it allows you to switch the placement of two of your own pieces. Of course, you may also <i>pretend</i>⑰ to switch them.

Additionally, if either of the two cards was exposed by Virus Checker, it gets flipped back face down.

I get it!

With Change Directory, she can switch out that Virus Card she placed near the enemy's Server!

And just as expected, Faris exchanges the Virus Card with a card that 4℃ has surrounded with his cards. Or maybe she just <i>pretended</i>⑰ to.

Either way, nobody knows which card is the Link Card and which is the Virus Card. Nobody except for Faris, that is.

A pretty interesting ploy.

But will it work?

The Viral Attackers whisper to each other. Once they're finished, 4℃ returns to the Circuit Mat with a shit-eating grin on his face.

Wait... is that right!?

If the card 4℃ takes now is a Link Card, then he wins.

But even if it's a Virus Card, it'll still be match point. And then he'll know which card to take for sure.

It's going to end without Faris demonstrating any of her power.

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0064" mode="on">

Is it over?

The Virals have taken three Link Cards and three Virus Cards. Match point.

But 4℃'s right. That doesn't even matter.

Faris only has two cards left.

And 4℃ already knows which is the Link Card and which is the Virus Card.

Faris's Link Card is surrounded by the Virals' cards.

There's nowhere to run.

Does this mean Faris is going to lose?

No way.

There's gotta be some advice I can give her!

Gh, can't think of anything.

<voice name="4℃" class="VID_SHI" src="voice/SDO_0065" mode="on">
"The End. The world has dyed black the closing of this RaiNet century."

4℃ poses as if in ecstasy, with both hands stretched wide and his chin cocked up.

"Hashida? As in Hashida Suzu?"

Faris's dad nods.

Suzuha's pseudonym. My pulse rises instantly upon hearing that name.

She did it. She found an IBN 5100.

She brought it to Akiba.

She completed her mission.

Tears well up in my eyes. I bite them back.

There's no way the IBN 5100 will arrive from France in time. And I doubt we could afford to pay for it anyway.

Plus, there's a high possibility the buyer is related to SERN, or to the Rounders.

It's well past midnight, and I'm still awake.

My body hurts too much to sleep. And then there's the question eating at my mind.



What should I do?

How can I cancel the D-Mail that saved Faris's father?


My encounter with the man himself has given birth to unnecessary internal conflict.

I'm about to steal Faris's father away from her.

I need to do it to save Mayuri.

But does that give me the right to play God?

Why is she talking normally?

She usually pretends to be a catgirl. Does this mean she's not using her Faris persona right now?

Is this the real Akiha Rumiho? 


It's actually refreshing to hear Faris talk normally like this.

It excites me for some reason. Like she's showing me a side of herself that no one has ever seen.

Her father is sleeping in the room next door, so she probably doesn't want him to hear. She cries into my chest, muffling her sobs.

I can't stay sad when Faris is trying to cheer me up.

I steel myself for what I need to do.

Yesterday, just before she left the room, Faris told me the contents of the first D-Mail she sent.

"100 mil for your kid. Take the train"

That mail stopped her father from getting on the airplane.

As a result, he didn't die.

But that wasn't the only effect it had on the timeline.

Her father needed to sell the IBN 5100 to prepare the hundred million yen ransom.

As a result, Faris never donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
With her father alive, Faris didn't participate in Akihabara's city development conferences. Otaku-oriented businesses never took root in Akiba.

MayQueen+Nyan⑯ never opened.

Faris wasn't as busy, which allowed her to join the RaiNet tournament circuit.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
In other words, this worldline's Faris has a normal life.

On the worldline I came from, Faris was not only a student, but also the heir to her father's company, an influential member of the Akihabara development board, and a part-time maid waitress.

Which life is better for her?

Which will give her greater happiness?

That's not my decision. It's hers.


And her decision is to return to the way things were.

I'm just here to help her wake up from this dream.

Faris has already entered the cancellation D-Mail.

I think ten years is about the limit of how far back we can send D-Mails.

Phone mail didn't become widespread until then.

Lukako's mom's pager was a special case, but even that was still limited to the 1990's.

So I don't think we can do anything fancy, like tell Faris's dad to start stockpiling IBN 5100s in 1975.

Something like this was bound to happen.

It's a small comfort, but I knew the risks when I chose this path.

Given that canceling the Suzuha D-Mail only changed divergence by 0.07%, a change of 0.2% likely means a dramatic shift in the worldline, at least from my perspective.


It's entirely possible that past events on this worldline -- my relationships included -- are very different from what I remember.


As proof...

...With the sole exception of Faris, all contacts have disappeared from my phone.

That's nothing but pure horror to me.

To save Mayuri and Faris's father, we warped the fabric of time even more than it had been warped already.

To lose everyone other than Faris...

That would be unbearable.

That can't have happened. They can't have disappeared. I'm sure they still exist.

My phone is just... broken is all. Yeah, that's probably it.


I knew this might happen. I accepted the risks.

I should know by tonight.

If things go as scheduled, Mayuri will die.

Finally, Faris blasts off!

If I dodge, Faris is sure to fall flat on her face. That's how fast she's going.

So to prevent that, I catch her in my arms.

Ahh, here's where I lose my virginity. Farewell, virginity. I would have preferred to give it away, rather than have it taken by force... but oh well.

All I can do now is prepare myself.

Suddenly, Faris falls silent.

When I look down, she's pressing her face against my chest, muffling her sobs.

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0532" mode="on">

Faris's words hit me like a blow.

I feel exactly the same way.

The Faris I knew is gone forever.

So are Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu.


This worldline closely resembles mine. Nothing is missing... but everything has changed.

My memories seem real, and I know that they are.

But with no one else to share them, they might as well be a dream.


I'm all alone in this world.

Alienated. Isolated.

My friends will never remember me.

The events in my memories never happened.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3798" mode="on">
"But this..."

I gently embrace Faris's small head.

"Yeah."

The path I chose so that neither Mayuri nor Faris's dad would die.

I won the bet, so in return, I have to live with this loneliness, this isolation.

Nothing is free. Everything has a price.

I sacrificed Suzuha's memories to save Mayuri.


That's what Suzuha wanted.

It's only fair that I give up something myself.

So I'm okay with this.

Because, objectively speaking, I reached my goal.

I'm okay.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3801" mode="on">
"I'm glad I have you, Faris. I want you to know that."

Mayuri and Daru are strangers now.

Kurisu has probably returned to America.

Without Faris, without her affection, I don't know what I would have done.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_3802" mode="on">

I gently take the cat-ear headband off of Faris' head.

Her long hair falls down and dangles onto my face.

Ignoring my inner shyness, I say her name.

With difficulty, we exchange a kiss, like hummingbirds pecking at nectar.

Then Faris slowly smiles.

Her smile, her lingering tears, her everything... is awfully cute.

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0543" mode="on">
"You're my prince, you know?"

This is the second time she's told me that.

<voice name="Faris" class="VID_FEI" src="voice/FEI_0545" mode="on">
"Yay."

I can no longer return to my original worldline.

I don't intend to, either.

I'll keep living on this worldline.

And Faris will be by my side.

I hear cheers.

The finals are about to begin.

Of course, our opponents are the Viral Attackers.

On the previous worldline, Faris's victory turned into a desperate chase through Akiba.

But that's another thing that never happened.

Normally, I would have refused to stand here.

Since I didn't get my memories back, I could've stepped down, and the cheerful catgirl would've probably accepted, and then proceed to fight alone.

But still I'm standing here, even though I'm aware I'm a burden.

"I've decided. This is my home now."

The story of Hououin Kyouma, of Okabe Rintaro, begins here anew.

The first line on a blank page.

I discard my feelings for the worldline that never happened.

In order to live here from now on, I will become this worldline's Okabe Rintaro.

My head spins. I feel faint.

Slowly, the world reasserts itself.

Maybe, like Suzuha said, it still exists as another possible worldline.

Or maybe it ceased to exist the moment I sent the D-Mail.

You'd have to be a god to observe each and every worldline, so it's pointless to worry about it.

I can never return to that worldline again.

Faris can never see her father again.

The worldline is still twisted.

I try asking again.

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0243" mode="on">
"...I don't know anything."

The look on her face betrays her.

Lukako is lying.

But why?


Remember. She shouldn't even know about the IBN 5100.

Why does she know?

Because the worldline changed. There's no other answer.

Her D-Mail must be the cause.

In Faris's case, I didn't know what her D-Mail was about.

But in Lukako's case, I already know what it is.

"I want to be a girl."

The D-Mail must have had influence beyond Lukako's sex. The Butterfly Effect.

It somehow changed the location of the IBN 5100.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00470]
It was like that with Suzuha, and with Faris.

I can't help but think that the universe itself is keeping the IBN 5100 away from me.

At any rate, when Lukako sent her D-Mail, Reading Steiner activated. Meaning the D-Mail changed the worldline.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00480]
If the IBN 5100 won't return to me on this worldline, then my next step is to cancel Lukako's D-Mail.


In other words, I need to turn Lukako back into a guy.

Suddenly, I feel dizzy. It's not heatstroke, and it's not Reading Steiner.

How am I going to explain this to Lukako herself?

Just the other day, when I called Lukako a guy, she cried. Then Kurisu and Mayuri ganged up on me.

Can I get Lukako to go back to being a guy without stirring up trouble?

This is going to be tough.

Maybe I should consult someone about this.

At first, I consider consulting Kurisu, but I don't think I should talk to a girl this time.

Let's think a little...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00490]
I visit Tennouji's house.

The divergence meter is here. I need to know what it says.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00500]

Little by little, I'm approaching the goal of 1% divergence.

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I walk past her and enter the development room.

There sits the Time Leap Machine.

Today is Saturday, the 14th of August.

The first time Mayuri died, it happened on Friday the 13th.

After Suzuha's sacrifice changed the worldline, Mayuri died on the 14th instead. Her death was delayed 24 hours exactly.

If that pattern continues, her death on this worldline should occur tomorrow, the 15th.

Just to be safe, I should buy a few days with the Time Leap Machine. I'll need time to solve the Lukako problem.

I should time leap right away.

Just before entering the lab, I peeked into the Braun Tube Workshop. The 42-inch CRT was on, so there's no problem there.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
Still...

It's all second nature to me now.

ComiMa started today, so Mayuri's been in Ariake since this morning.

I told Daru not to come to the lab today, but to keep an eye on Mayuri instead.

So even if Moeka's group shows up here, they have a low chance of killing Mayuri.

I'm not saying this for myself.

From my perspective, when the worldline changes, everything until that point becomes undone.

But what about from Lukako's perspective?

What if this worldline continues after I leave it behind?



The Lukako of this worldline will have to live with what I did to her.

That possibility exists. Suzuha said that's not the case, but there's no way to be sure.

And since I can't confirm or deny that possibility, I don't want to use Kurisu's last resort.

Besides, I have the Time Leap Machine.

And as long as I have it, I can repeat the days before Mayuri's death forever.

Of course, there's still the danger of a time leap failure...

In any case, the first thing I should do is have an honest talk with the girl in question.

It's nice and cool early in the morning, even though it's the middle of summer.

When I reach the shrine, I find Lukako standing alone in the courtyard. She's dressed in regular clothes instead of her miko garb.

She still hasn't noticed me.

I stop and watch in fascination.

I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window.

It's morning now.

It's nice and cool early in the morning, even though it's the middle of summer.

Too bad the cicadas are already chirping.

The sun's not too strong yet.

This is the second time I've woken up like this, though the date was different the first time.

In any case, my mental state is exactly the same as back then.

Through the front door, I hear someone stomping up the stairs.

I jump up, thinking it's Moeka, but then I realize who it is.

But still...

I'm on a mission to change Lukako back into a guy.

I need to accomplish that mission to save Mayuri.

If I forget he's a guy and lose my self-control, it could result in... complications.

<PRE @box00>[text00970]
Going out with the current Lukako isn't the problem.

I mean, I still have my reservations, but cuteness is justice, right?

Besides, I'm supposed to be saving Mayuri, not going out on dates.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00980]
But on the other hand, Lukako's cooperation is essential to save Mayuri.

I won't get anywhere if I reject Lukako and make her cry.

For the sake of my goal, I must overcome the problems of my heart.

I'll do it.

I'll take Lukako's deal.

But if we're going to do this, I tell myself, there's one rule that you must follow.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00990]
...You must not fall in love with Lukako.

Even if it means trampling on her heart, you must not fall in love.



Fall in love, and you could end up walking the forbidden path.

This "conversation" thing isn't going so well.

I tried to follow the guide's advice and be a good listener, but Lukako's silent by nature. She doesn't really start talking on her own.

Even at the family restaurant, the words we exchanged were mostly just things like "It's crowded today," "It's delicious," and "It was delicious."

And I think it was a mistake to just wander around.

Especially since we've ended up in a residential area with no interesting scenery whatsoever.

I didn't expect he'd actually come with me.

But when he did, I realized that he had potential.

That's why I bought him the 980 yen (tax included) demon sword.

Afterwards, Lukako and I went through intense training to develop the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship.

In retrospect, I can't believe I said all that ridiculous stuff. It makes me want to crawl in a hole and hide.

All through the date, I couldn't stop thinking about the time Lukako fell in love with me, so I barely made conversation at all.

Lukako might refuse to turn back into a guy.

...No, Lukako's not like that.

Mayuri's life hangs in the balance, so I'm sure no matter what I say, she'll turn back.

Or is it naive of me to think that?

Either way...

Instead of returning to the lab, I stand on the bridge in front of the station and gaze blankly at the stream of people.

Faris might be visiting the lab.

Faris was at the lab on this day when I first came to this worldline.

My actions shouldn't have influenced Mayuri's, so she should have called Faris over to show her the costumes.

Right now, I don't want to see anybody.

I need to think.

But try as I might, no ideas come. No solutions.

Lukako agreed to go back to being a guy if I went out with her for a time. I've stayed faithful to that, so...

Faithful? How?

I just made a huge mistake back there!

I've done nothing but make Lukako sad.

Tomorrow...

Tomorrow is the 15th. The day ComiMa opens. The day Mayuri dies.

At the very least, I need to make our relationship last until that evening.

Tomorrow is the end.

But I'm not confident I can show Lukako a fun time.

Alright. So instead of fussing over a date, I'll just try something that won't make Lukako sad.

The next morning, after Mayuri and Daru have left for Ariake, I head to the shrine to pick up Lukako.

We hop the train at Akiba station. When she looks askance at me, I tell her we're going to see Mayuri.

Today it won't just be the two of us.

I don't know what to say when we're alone. I'm afraid I'll just hurt her again.

It's time to try something different.

When we get off the train at Tokyo Big Sight, Lukako stares in wonder at the scene spread before her.

People, people, people.

People as far as the eye can see.

Welcome to ComiMa, the otaku festival.

It's the first day, so Big Sight's more crowded than usual.

This is my plan: to take Lukako to ComiMa.

I'm not making her cosplay, of course. Lukako wouldn't even do it at Mayuri's request, and I don't want to force her to do anything she doesn't want to.




We're just here to look and have fun.

The first order of business is to hook up with Mayuri and Daru. Those two live and breathe ComiMa, so I'm sure they'll have a lot to talk about.

Conversation will flow, and I'll be off the hook.


How wonderful to have friends you can count on!

Of course, bringing a date to ComiMa is a surefire way to earn myself the hatred of otaku everywhere, but no matter. I'll endure their contempt if that's what it takes to make Lukako happy.

So resolved, I strike out through the crowd towards our designated rendezvous point. Lukako, clearly overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, struggles to follow behind.

By the time we get back to Akiba, Lukako and I are exhausted. My feet feel like blocks of lead, and I don't have the energy to even attempt conversation.


The two of us schlep back to the shrine without speaking a word, like Spanish monks under a vow of silence.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
Lukako doesn't raise a single complaint.

But taking her to ComiMa was obviously a mistake.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
Lukako's expression has been stiff ever since we met up with Mayuri.

Maybe she's still traumatized by otaku.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
The first time I met Lukako, he was being harassed by otaku.


Maybe they left a bad impression.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
We don't talk.

We spent most of the day shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers. I can probably count on my fingers the words I said directly to Lukako today.

When we arrive at the shrine, our time as a couple will end.

So this is our last chance to talk as boyfriend and girlfriend.

But I'm confused.

What should I talk about?

I try thinking about things we have in common.

The demon sword, Samidare.

The Seishin Zanma style of swordmanship.

But Kurisu said to avoid chuunibyou topics, and the dating manual concurred.

What else is there?

It finally dawns on me.

There's nothing else Lukako and I share.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
Silence dominates the shrine.

The silence should be calming, but it's not.

I've safely escorted Lukako home.

Mayuri's death is just three hours away.



The temporary relationship between me and Lukako ends here.

Now I just need Lukako to give me her mother's pager number.

However...

Is it really okay to let it end like this?

In the end, what have I done for Lukako?

I haven't done squat, have I?

All I've done is hurt her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0375" mode="on">
"Uuh... hic..."


Suddenly, Lukako starts sobbing. She covers her mouth with both hands, but can't stop the tears pouring from her eyes.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4059" mode="on">
"Lukako..."

When I approach her, Lukako pulls back.

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0376" mode="on">
"Uugh... ugg... sniff..."

Lukako wipes the corners of her eyes, but the tears keep flowing, forming a glistening line down each cheek.

I'm speechless. I have no idea what to do.

A girl is crying before my eyes.

It's my duty as a man to comfort her.

I know that, and yet no words come. I just stand there, like a useless statue.

The cause of Lukako's tears is undoubtedly me.

I didn't treat her right as my girlfriend, even if it was only a temporary arrangement.

And now it ends with me <I>watching</i>⑰ as Lukako cries.


Lukako...


I'm the one who did this to her. I'm the cause of her grief.

And yet...

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0377" mode="on">

That has to be a lie.

To my surprise, Lukako takes my hand in hers.

Her hand is very warm and delicate.



This is the first time I've touched her since we became a couple.


And... it will be the last.

Lukako places a note in my hand.

And then, she pulls away.

She bows her head again.

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0381" mode="on">

Lukako turns her back to me, then disappears into the shrine office.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4061" mode="on">

I look at the note.

There's a number written there.

Probably her mother's pager number.

She kept her promise.

But I...

I didn't keep mine.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
I can't let it end like this.

<PRE @box00>[text00290]
I run full speed back to the lab. Ignoring Kurisu's calls to stop, I slap on the headgear and leap to the past.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
I regain consciousness in front of Akihabara Station.

Lukako is next to me. We're about to board the train for ComiMa.

Lukako looks a little anxious, but she doesn't raise a single complaint.

The shuttle bus pulls up. The huge line of people begins to move.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4062" mode="on">

We can't go to ComiMa like this.

Shaking off my time leap-induced vertigo, I take Lukako by the hand.

"O-Okabe-san? Um, the bus is here..."

I keep walking with Lukako's hand in mine, ignoring everything else.

Lukako looks bewildered at first, but eventually, she says no more, and just starts following me with a sad expression.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
We arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine.

A place devoid of visitors.

Where an aura of peace and dignity dominates.

Where the cries of cicadas resound.

Lukako's home.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
Finally, I turn to face Lukako.


Instead of letting go, I grasp her warm hand even tighter than before.

Perhaps it's the heat, or perhaps it's our nervousness, but our hands are damp with sweat.

But still, I don't let go.

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0387" mode="on">

Lukako is hanging her head.

She might cry at any moment.

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0388" mode="on">
"This means... our relationship is over, doesn't it..."

Her lips tremble. Her voice trembles.

I summon my resolve and answer her with a laugh.

We spend four hours training, just like we used to.


Practice swings with the demon sword.

Stories of the sword's history.

Lectures on the intricacies of Seishin Zanma swordsmanship.

All fabricated from my chuunibyou delusions.

I talk. Lukako, dressed now in her miko robes, listens with rapt attention.

Occasionally, we take a break, sit on the shrine's stairway, and eat the sweet rice balls Lukako's mother brings us.

And that's how we spend an extraordinarily ordinary four hours.

Either way, it doesn't matter. There's no point in retrieving a broken IBN 5100.

But I don't tell her that.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4105" mode="on">

<voice name="Luka" class="VID_RUK" src="voice/RUK_0437" mode="on">
"Kyouma-san..."

That's why I must bear the burden.

Mayuri's pain. Suzuha's pain. Faris's pain.

And now... Lukako's pain.

Something occurs to me.

What if...

What if I send a D-Mail telling Lukako not to sweep the storehouse? How would that change the worldline?

Would the IBN 5100 stay at Yanabayashi Shrine, ready for me to retrieve in August, as planned?

Part of me wants to try sending that D-Mail.

If it works, Lukako could stay a girl.

No. I mustn't give into the temptation.

My goal is to restore the worldline, not warp it further.

Fix the past to save Mayuri.

That is my mission.

So Lukako swept the storehouse because she became a girl.

Because she swept the storehouse, she broke the IBN 5100, and deposited it into this coin locker.


As a result, the IBN 5100 will never reach me.

Is this the Butterfly Effect?

When she sees this, Lukako's mother will probably think it's a prank.

And then she'll assume the D-Mail we sent earlier was also a prank.

If that still doesn't change the worldline, we can just try something else.

Pagers in 1992 didn't display the sender's number. Lukako's mother won't know who sent it.

If I turn around, what will I see on her face?

I want to check, but I don't think she'd want that.

Lukako finally smiled for me today, but I still have lingering reservations inside.

This time, I'm about to sacrifice Lukako's memories.

The memories of the 17 years she lived as a girl on this worldline.

The memories of her parents, who rejoiced when their daughter was born.

I'm about to erase all of that.

But if I don't, I will be rejecting the 17 years Lukako lived as a guy.

I will be rejecting the memories of his parents, who rejoiced when their son was born.

Even so.

Is it okay to turn Lukako back into a guy?

I could hear my teeth grinding.

I knew that whether Mayuri would get to see tomorrow depended entirely on my actions.



If this day had gone as planned, my status as Lukako's temporary boyfriend would have come to a close.

Lukako would have gone back to being a guy.

Mayuri would survive the night.

She would go to ComiMa tomorrow without a care in the world.

Mayuri cheerfully flew out the door, suitcase in hand, like the white rabbit in Wonderland.

The sound of her footsteps gradually faded away.

Now alone, I took a deep breath.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00310]
The time limit was 13 hours after that point in time.

In those 13 hours, I was to return Lukako to manhood.

I thought I had to change her back.

But now...

<PRE @box00>[text00320]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1173" mode="on">
"Okarin?"

A voice calls me back to the present.

There's Mayuri, dragging her suitcase. Daru isn't with her.

She's probably upset.

After all, I completely stood her up on the promise we made this morning.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4145" mode="on">
"Sorry."

I can't look Mayuri in the eye.

As Mayuri was waiting in vain, I was making the worst possible decision for her.

I chose to not turn Lukako back.

I chose to not save Mayuri.

No, let's not beat around the bush.

I chose to <I>let her die.</i>⑰

It's not that I don't want to save her. I do.

But I can't bring myself to make the necessary sacrifice.

"Did you make her cry again?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4147" mode="on">
"No..."

My thoughts are a jumble.

Her every word seems an accusation. Of course, I know that's not her intent. Even if she knew what I had done, this innocent childhood friend of mine doesn't have a bitter bone in her body.



It's my guilty conscience, changing Mayuri's words into swords stabbing straight through the heart.

But even so, I can no longer change the past. I don't want to change it.

So I have no other choice.

No other choice but to accept the death this world so desires.

If I were a normal man, I would have had to accept Mayuri's death whether I liked it or not. I wouldn't have been able to try to avert it.

But by chance, I acquired the power of a god. It allowed me to try again and again. If anything, I should be grateful for the opportunity I was given.

I can't let Mayuri sense my unease.

She can always tell when there's something bothering me.

Ten minutes left.

I want her to spend them happy and carefree. That's the very least I can do for her.

So I put on the mask of Hououin Kyouma, just as I did for Lukako.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4148" mode="on">

As soon as those words leave my lips, I realize my mistake.

...Well, I suppose that is what happened.

But Mayuri didn't need to know that.

I knew you would pull no punches, Makise Kurisu.



Lukako's image floats through my mind.

She used to be a guy.

But now she's a girl. And she'll live as a girl from now on.

I am the one who chose that future for Lukako.

When I imagine her frail smile, I feel like spring has come to thaw the frozen soil of my heart.

I can't bear to lose Lukako too.

In that case... I know what I must do.

As I enter the courtyard, I can almost feel the heat slowly drain away.

Beside the main building stands a large tree. Its branches, coated with vibrant leaves, sway in the gentle breeze.

The shrine is cooler than the streets of Akihabara proper. Maybe it's because Kanda River is so close.



As usual, the shrine is empty.

I find myself standing before the offering box, gazing into the inner sanctum.

I wonder if Lukako's home.

Her family should be here too. How should I call for her?

Just then, the wind suddenly lets up, and the sound of rustling trees stops for a bit.

In the silence, I hear someone sobbing.

It sounds like it's coming from behind the main building.

I slowly head towards the sound.

So she's choosing the morning of that fateful day, so she can cosplay with a smile.

But to jump to that day would take at least three consecutive leaps.

Will she be able to get all the way to the 15th?

But despite my worries, Lukako's remains undaunted.

I cover Lukako's head with the Time Leap Machine's headgear.

Her body is clearly shaking.

But that's understandable, I guess.

Even I'm starting to get tense. My heart feels like it's about to explode.

This is the first Time Leap Machine experiment with a subject other than me.

I can't stop thinking about the worst case scenario.

Immediately afterwards, the discharge fills the room.

I open my eyes wide in wonder as Lukako's body begins to shine.

This time, I wasn't the one who leaped.

But nevertheless, I teleported from the lab to Yanabayashi Shrine.

Did the worldline change?

No. Reading Steiner didn't activate, so I don't think it did.

Then why?

Was it because of Lukako's changes to the past?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00460]

The warmth of Lukako's hand slips away as the vertigo hits me.

Lukako might still like me, even though he's a guy again.

However, he'll never speak honestly about those feelings.

This is what Lukako decided for himself. It would be wrong to pry any further.

Maybe I'm just running away.

Maybe I should pry, force him to confront his feelings.

But I'm not strong enough to accept the consequences. I'll just end up hurting Lukako.

Which means the IBN 5100 should be here at the shrine.

On the previous worldline, girl Lukako broke the IBN 5100 while cleaning the storehouse.

When Lukako was a girl, she trembled when I asked her the same question.

And then she forced a smile, as if to avoid admitting that she broke the computer.

Lukako honestly doesn't know.

He heads into the storeroom out back, just like on the previous worldline.

But on the previous worldline, the IBN 5100 was no longer in the storehouse, since girl Lukako had secretly moved it.

How will it turn out this time?

Luka's dad returns after about 10 minutes. His expression is grave.

That's all the answer I need.

Nothing has changed.

The IBN 5100 is still out of reach.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
First, the one I sent to myself with the winning LOTO SIX numbers.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
That one should be easy to cancel.

The problem is the other one, the one sent by someone I wish I could forget.




</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Kiryu Moeka.

I know the gist of her D-Mail, since she sent it as part of our early experiments.


When Moeka asked to send a D-Mail, I agreed under two conditions.

First, make the contents simple enough that the D-Mail's effects would be obvious.

Second, make the contents public to all lab mems.

Moeka ended up sending a D-Mail to prevent herself from buying a new phone a few days prior.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
The D-Mail was sent to July 31st, an easy date to remember.


The question is how it relates to the theft of the IBN 5100.

It must be the Butterfly Effect, as it was with Lukako's D-Mail.

This time, however, I will not hesitate to do what is necessary.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Kiryu Moeka does not deserve my sympathy.

That woman and her men have killed Mayuri more times than I can bear to remember.

I will show her no mercy.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
There's just one problem.

The cancellation D-Mail needs to be sent from Moeka's own phone.

I don't think a message from me telling her not to change phones would sway Moeka's intentions in the slightest.

I need her phone, but I don't know where to find her.

What do I do?



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]

Mayuri is still alive.

Going by the pattern, her death has probably been postponed until about this time tomorrow.

Kurisu will go to her first ComiMa.

Mayuri will be so delighted when I tell her the news.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00490]
I haven't seen Mayuri all day.

I want to be with her, of course, but that's not possible.

Moeka hasn't replied, which means I have to find her myself.


Unfortunately, I don't know anything about her.

My only clue is Arc Rewrite, the company Moeka supposedly worked at.


I find it after a quick search online.

Sure enough, their business is producing articles for PC magazines.

Luckily, their office is in Akiba.

I try calling first, but it goes to voice mail.

I guess they're still closed for the Obon holiday.

Or maybe it's just a bad time?


Looks like I've got no choice but to visit them in person.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00500]
It's the second day of ComiMa and Akiba is deserted. Most of the otaku are lined up at Big Sight right now.



I've experienced the craze of ComiMa several times firsthand. It's literal war.

It scares me whenever Mayuri goes alone. I can't help but imagine her trampled by a horde of crazed otaku.


But in reality, Mayuri's surprisingly quick and tough. I've seen her weave through crowds like you wouldn't believe.


Kurisu's the one more likely to get trampled.

I can't help but feel sorry for her. Maybe it was wrong to ask her to go.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00510]
I find the Arc Rewrite office in a fancy-looking building on the outskirts of Akiba.


I take the elevator up, but there's nobody there. I lean against the wall and wait.

After about thirty minutes, a man dressed in shirt and tie appears. I explain that I'm a relative of Kiryu Moeka and ask for her contact info.

But he gives an unexpected answer.

<voice name="Male　Staff-Member" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STA_0000" mode="on">
"We don't have an employee by that name."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4275" mode="on">
"You... don't?"

Damn! I've been tricked!

I should have known better. Moeka is working for SERN. Of course her place of employment is fake.


Is this the end of the line?

Just as I'm about to turn around and leave, the man pounds his hand as if he remembered something.

<voice name="Male　Staff-Member" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STA_0001" mode="on">
"Wait a second. There was a girl who worked here just two days before disappearing. I think her name might've been Kiryu."

<voice name="Male　Staff-Member" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/STA_0002" mode="on">
"We might still have her resume."

I frantically bow my head and ask him to look for it. He's reluctant, but acquiesces.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00520]
The address listed on the resume leads me to a beat-up old apartment.

Not the sort of place you'd expect a single young woman to live.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00530]
I feel a strange unease as I approach the apartment.

For some reason, there's a police car parked in front of the complex.

I bow my thanks and leave.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00580]
She's dead?

Moeka's dead?

What's going on? It doesn't make sense.


Suicide?

Moeka... who killed Mayuri in cold blood... committed suicide?

Or is this part of the conspiracy?

Could her own men have killed her, then made it look like a suicide?

Today is the 16th.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00590]
On worldline Alpha 1, Moeka raided the lab on the 13th.

Three days have passed since then.

Each time I change worldlines, Mayuri's death gets pushed back one day. So does Moeka's raid.

It hasn't happened yet on this worldline.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00600]
So why did she die?

I don't get it.

This is the first time this has happened.

How should I deal with this?

What should I do?

I squat on the ground and cradle my head in confusion.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00610]
If Moeka is dead, maybe Mayuri doesn't have to die.

...No. I don't think convergence is that kind.

Fate demands Mayuri's death.

Whenever I try to stop it, <I>something</i>⑰ interferes.

True, I'm the one who meddled with the timeline, but haven't I paid the price already?


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00620]
How did all this happen?

A few weeks ago, I was just a college student with a severe case of chuunibyou.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00630]
Save for Mayuri's grandmother, I had never experienced the death of anyone close to me.


Death had no place in my life.

But how many times have I faced death these past three days -- more, when you count the loops I've made?

My heart can't take it anymore.

I don't know how much longer I can go on.

One more.

Just one more D-Mail to cancel.

If I can just get my hands on Moeka's phone...

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4284" mode="on">
"Time leap..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
Moeka died yesterday around noon.

I can go back to before that happened.

The reason she died isn't important. Whether Mayuri's murderer kills herself is of no concern to me.



I just need to cancel that D-Mail!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
Upon returning to the lab, I casually look up at the second floor window.

And what I see shocks me to my core.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4285" mode="on">
"Electrical discharge!?"

Someone is using the Time Leap Machine!

Who!?

Mayuri and Daru should be at ComiMa.

Not even Kurisu should be here. I asked her to escort Mayuri yesterday.



Besides, she's against changing the past.

So who!?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
The building shakes.

I can't let this happen. The timeline mustn't be tampered with again!



I need to stop it now!

By the time I get there, the shaking has stopped.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
I quietly peek into the development room.

Nobody's there.

The door was unlocked. Anyone could have walked right in.


How could we be so careless?

The Time Leap Machine is still faintly warm.

So somebody did use it.

Who?

Did they time leap?



This is the first time someone else has used the Time Leap Machine.



Just to make sure, I check the X68000.


As expected, the history's been erased. The same thing happens when we send a D-Mail.

...There's nothing I can do about this.


It worries me, but I have to focus on Moeka.

I set up the Time Leap Machine.

The maximum leap time is 48 hours. To leap more than that, you need to leap 48 hours and then leap again.

The 42-inch CRT is on downstairs.

That's plain as day, since the discharge phenomenon just occurred.

I put on the headgear.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Preparations complete.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
...Should I really leap now?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Don't be ridiculous. Of course I should.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Just a little more, and I can save Mayuri once and for all.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I know what will happen if I don't leap now.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
Mayuri will die, and I will taste that pain and despair once again.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
And then, I will leap. It's the same either way.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
...I close my phone.

There's no need to rush. Calm down.

I can endure the pain, if need be.

I should exploit my one advantage, the Time Leap Machine, to the fullest extent possible, and that means knowing exactly when Mayuri will die.


The pattern suggests that Mayuri's death should happen around 7 or 8 tonight.

But things are a little different this time. Moeka killed herself before Mayuri was scheduled to die.


How much influence will that have on convergence?

There's a chance Mayuri won't die. We might already have won.


In that case, I shouldn't waste my effort time leaping.

I have no obligation to save Moeka.

I'll wait until Kurisu contacts me.

It's 12:30 now. There are still about 7 hours left.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
I hear nothing but the slow, steady tick of the clock.

The sound is echoing inside my head. Even if I plug my ears, it doesn't stop.

I spent several hours searching for the IBN 5100, but as expected, I found nothing.

I still can't imagine how Moeka's D-Mail affected the computer's whereabouts. What does her phone model have to do with anything?

Does keeping the same phone somehow tell her that there's an IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine?

That doesn't make sense.

Even the Butterfly Effect must have limits.

But on the other hand, truth is often stranger than fiction. Sometimes the simplest things have consequences that no one could ever imagine.


So I can't rule it out entirely either.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4287" mode="on">
"In other words... I have nothing."

I twist my lips into a sneer of self-mockery.

It's 7:46 PM, the moment of truth.

If Mayuri is indeed fated to die today, I should be hearing from Kurisu soon.

I hope nothing happens.

All that I ask is to hear Mayuri's voice -- to know, once and for all, that she is safe.

Silently, I apologize to Kurisu for forcing her to watch it happen.

I leave the lab without waiting for the others to respond.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00320]
Suddenly, the empty room is full of familiar faces.


Mayuri is sitting on the sofa, working on her costumes and rubbing her tired eyes.

Daru is at his PC, muttering to himself.

Kurisu is in the development room, tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

Where is Moeka now?

Should I try going to her apartment again?

Honestly, I'm afraid to meet her face to face. I don't know what I might do.




That woman killed Mayuri.

Innocent Mayuri, sewing with all she's got...

I've seen the blood drain from her body.

I've seen the light fade from her eyes.

If I see Moeka, will I be able to contain my rage?

...It doesn't matter. I can't run away.

In order to save Mayuri, I must meet with Moeka.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
I head to Moeka's ratty apartment. There's no sign of the police this time.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
Moeka's suicide won't happen for another four days.

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Damn. Might as well try the doorknob.

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
It's unlocked.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I take a deep breath.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
This could be a trap. Remember, we're not dealing with an ordinary person. Moeka is a Rounder, an agent of SERN.

If I die here, what will happen to Mayuri?

Will Kurisu or Daru use the Time Leap Machine to save her?

I need to be careful.

But at the same time, I can't save Mayuri by doing nothing.

So I steel myself, open the door, and peek inside.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
The apartment is dark, too dark to see.

But I feel someone's presence.

I step inside.

The apartment is practically empty.

Minimal furnishings.

Only the barest necessities of life.



But there, by the window, is a figure in the moonlight.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
A woman is sitting on the floor, her head bowed.

There's no one else here.

I approach the woman and stare down at her, gritting my teeth in a desperate effort to maintain control.


Ever since the first time she killed Mayuri, I've tried my best to avoid thinking about this woman.



But now, I have no choice.

I can't accomplish my goal until I have the answers I need from her.

I must obtain the IBN 5100 to escape the Alpha attractor field and rescue Mayuri.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4292" mode="on">
"...Kiryu Moeka."

I had another name for her once. It hurts to remember. I force it to the back of my mind.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4293" mode="on">
"Can you hear me?"

Moeka's fingers twitch.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
She sluggishly lifts her head.

But she doesn't look up. She stares at my feet instead.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0286" mode="on">
"...Who?"

She finally speaks in a frail voice.

Moeka has always had trouble speaking, but it seems especially severe today.

I notice her hair and clothes are disheveled. She looks awful, though I suppose that's no surprise, given that she kills herself in four days.


<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0287" mode="on">
"...FB? Is it you?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4294" mode="on">

If I'm not mistaken, that's her superior's codename.


<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0288" mode="on">
"Why won't you contact me? I did everything you told me to."

The phone in Moeka's hands glows faintly.

"uugh... uugh..."


I'm at a loss for words.

I wasn't expecting to find her in such a miserable state.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
She was so cold, so calm when she killed Mayuri.

It's like she's a different person now.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
Is this another effect of the worldline change?

But it's only been a week since she sent her D-Mail. How could she have changed so much?


I get on my knees and shake Moeka by the shoulders.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4295" mode="on">
"Hey, can you hear me? Hey!"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0292" mode="on">
"FB... why... why won't you answer..."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4296" mode="on">
"Kiryu Moeka! Hey! It's me! Okabe!"

No response.

Moeka just keeps crying and mumbling to herself.

I shake harder, but she doesn't react. She doesn't even resist.

Looking down, I notice that she's typing rapidly on her phone.

Bewildered, I look at the screen.

FBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFB

FBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFB

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4297" mode="on">
"What the..."

What happened to Moeka?

From what little I understand, it sounds like she's lost contact with her supervisor, FB.

But I don't understand how that could turn Moeka into such a wreck.

...It doesn't matter. I don't care what happens to her.

I'm here for one thing.

Recalling my purpose, I reach for Moeka's phone.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0293" mode="on">
"No!"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
A sharp crack echoes through the room.

Moeka slapped my hand away.

It didn't hurt, but her reaction was lightning quick.

Now Moeka curls up into a ball, hugging the phone tightly to her chest.



It was like this from the moment I met her. She never let go of her phone, not even for a second, as if it were the only thing keeping her alive.


<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0294" mode="on">
"..."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0296" mode="on">
"...No mails."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0297" mode="on">
"No mails..."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4302" mode="on">
"...You mean from FB?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0298" mode="on">
"...No mails."

I make several more attempts to take her phone while she babbles incoherently, but she just slaps my hand away each time.


Next, I try persuasion. I promise to help her search for FB if she lends me her phone.

It's a lie, of course, though come to think of it, I would like a piece of FB, too.

But that can wait until after I've saved Mayuri.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0299" mode="on">
"...uugh..."

But Moeka doesn't buy it. If, that is, she heard me at all.


Dammit. We're not getting anywhere.

Maybe I should take it from her by force.

But what if she tries to kill me before I can send the D-Mail?


In her current state, she might not have the strength to retaliate.

On the other hand, if she does retaliate, there's not much I can do against someone with a gun.

What should I do?

Her gun...

Where would she keep it?

I quickly scan the room, but there's no sign of it.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
Crap! That startled me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
Could she have picked a worse time?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
I try again, this time asking nicely to borrow her phone.

Moeka doesn't reply. She's staring at her phone.

As she realizes that it's not her phone ringing, I see fresh tears pool in her eyes. She hangs her head.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0300" mode="on">
"Why won't you respond, FB? You're the one who recruited me..."

Moeka starts typing yet another mail.

I guess she really doesn't recognize me.

This is frustrating.

Why is she acting like the victim here?

Does she think she's a tragic heroine? Does she think she deserves sympathy?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
You don't have the right to be so weak.

Moeka did the same to us. She doesn't deserve mercy.


Kill her or let her live. It's my choice, my responsibility.

Even after I undo the murder, the memory of my crime will remain with me.

That sin -- that guilt -- I'll have to carry that weight. I mustn't ever forget.

That's what Kurisu meant when she spoke of responsibility.

Murder is unforgivable, no matter the circumstances.

In a fit of anger, I raise my hand to strike.

But at the last moment, I hesitate.

Damn. What happened to killing her if I have to!?

I know we're past the point of playing nice, but I've never hit a girl in my life.

I don't consider myself a model gentleman or anything, but the idea that men aren't supposed to hit women is such a strong part of my 'common sense' that it stayed my hand almost like instinct.

So instead, I wrap my hand around Moeka's neck and squeeze.

When she tries to kick me again, I pin her legs under my own.

I can undo it with the Time Leap Machine. It'll be the perfect crime, one that never happened.

It's taking all my strength just to pin her down.

Moeka writhes in pain. Tears fall from her eyes and drool from her mouth.

Why hasn't it changed?

Why is it the same as before Moeka sent her D-Mail?

Moeka's D-Mail said "don't change models." She should have had a different phone when she sent it.

But she didn't. It was the same phone I'm holding right now.

There's only one explanation. She never changed models to begin with.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4350" mode="on">
"No way..."

She lied to me!

Moeka's D-Mail wasn't about her phone!

It's too dangerous to let her be.

I'm stronger. I just need to get her on the ground.

<PRE @box00>[text01330]
Moeka turns her face away and looks up, through the open curtains, at the bright full moon outside the window.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01340]
How much time has passed?

It feels like it's already been dozens of hours.

But it's still night outside, so it probably hasn't been more than one or two.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01350]
Moeka hasn't said a word since I kissed her.

She hasn't tried to escape either. Her expression is blank. She's just staring off to the side.

What is she looking at? I follow her gaze, but the only thing there is a half-empty bottle of water.


Has she given up?

Either way, I can't let my guard down.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01360]
Maybe it's the stress, but it feels like my body is going numb.

And I've been drenched in sweat for a while now.

This room has no air conditioning whatsoever. The heat is starting to get to me.

I thought I had an overwhelming advantage in this position, but it's harder to maintain than I expected.


Not only do I have to keep Moeka pinned, I also have to keep a close eye on her so she doesn't try anything.



All Moeka has to do is lie there. She can rest and try again whenever she's ready.



Will this last all night?

At this rate, my strength might give out first.

Fear mounts. If she escapes, she's going to try to kill me. She must have her gun somewhere, I'm sure.


I consider calling Kurisu for help, but I can't use either hand, and I don't even know what time it is.

Damn, it's almost like I'm the one trapped!

No. Stay positive.

You can do this.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01370]
Moeka's dependent on her phone. That's her weak point.

If I keep her separated from her phone, then sooner or later, her will to resist should collapse.


It's a matter of whose strength will fail first.

<PRE @box00>[text01380]
Suddenly, Moeka calls my name.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0336" mode="on">
"What... do I have... to do?"

Now she's trying to ask nicely. Does this mean she's given up?


This is what I was waiting for. Now I move in for the kill.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4380" mode="on">
"Do you remember sending a D-Mail?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0337" mode="on">
"A D... what?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4381" mode="on">
"D-Mail. An email that you send to the past."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4382" mode="on">
"You sent one to your own phone."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4383" mode="on">
"You led me to think it was about a phone model exchange, but you changed the text before you sent it."

Her typing speed is lightning fast. It would have been easy for her to type a mere 36 characters while Daru and I were preoccupied with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4384" mode="on">
"Your D-Mail changed the past."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4385" mode="on">
"Don't you remember?"

Normally, once the past changes, everything until that point is undone.

But it should be possible to make Moeka remember, just as Faris and Lukako did.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0338" mode="on">
"I... don't know."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4386" mode="on">
"You do know. You just haven't remembered yet."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4387" mode="on">
"Remember. Remember, or else."

Or else what, I don't know.

This is just a tactic to put pressure on Moeka. I have another plan to make her remember.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01390]
<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0339" mode="on">
"..."

Moeka turns away again and bites her lip. Tears start falling from her eyes.

I watch, never once taking my eyes off her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01400]
I didn't notice before now, but her shirt must have become undone during the struggle.


I can see the alluring curves of her collarbone, the skin of her large, pale breasts, a hint of sexy underwear.

Her breasts heave with each painful breath.

The base of her neck is stained with the blood from my lip.

It's dry, like a scab.

Normally, Moeka could be mistaken for an elegant, beautiful woman.

But now she has large shadows under her eyes. Her skin is rough. Her face is pale.

She looks more intoxicated than intoxicating.

Her entire body reeks of death.


She's clearly insane.

This is the real Moeka. I wish I'd realized sooner.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01410]

"If I could remember... I would..."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0342" mode="on">
"But I don't... remember anything."

Moeka's gaze shifts constantly, from me to the ceiling and then to the window.



But her slow murmuring is evidence that she's almost beat.

Just a little more, and her resistance will end.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4388" mode="on">
"Fine. I'll change the question."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4394" mode="on">
"Why not!?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0348" mode="on">
"It's... my mission."

Her mission?


I recall what Moeka told me on a previous worldline.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01430]
The Rounders' mission is to find and acquire IBN 5100s.


In that case...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01440]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4395" mode="on">
"The IBN 5100."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0349" mode="on">
"!!"

She fell into my trap. Her reflexive response was all I needed to see.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4396" mode="on">
"It was about the IBN 5100."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0350" mode="on">
"How much... do you know?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4397" mode="on">
"I'm asking the questions here. Just answer."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0351" mode="on">
"I... can't."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0352" mode="on">
"I won't... betray... FB."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4398" mode="on">
"So you're choosing FB over your phone? How loyal."

But Mayuri's fate hangs in the balance. I can't give up.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01450]
Moeka still hasn't calmed down.

She's been opening and closing her hands for a while now.

She's not trying to escape my restraint. She's just twisting her body.

Licking her lips. Shaking her head, trying to brush the hair off her face.

It's like she's suffering from withdrawal without her phone.

Soon, she won't have the mental fortitude to resist.


If she won't talk now, then I'll just wait until she will.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4399" mode="on">
"Is it really that painful to not have your phone? Why are you so dependent on it?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0353" mode="on">
"I can't... talk to people."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4400" mode="on">

And when she attacked the lab, she was leading a squad of hardened killers.

But Moeka shakes her head violently.

Moeka's face contorts in despair.

Once again, tears fall from her eyes.

Guilt squeezes my heart. I know that I'm causing this woman pain.


Inside of me, a voice whispers that it's nothing compared to what she did to Mayuri, that I have no reason to show mercy to a murderer.


But at the same time, my conscience screams that it's wrong to hurt someone, no matter who they are or what they've done.

Insane mad scientist, my ass. I'm afraid to hurt my mortal enemy.

I'm nothing but a hypocrite.

"...'Leave the IBN 5100 at the designated location.'"

The IBN 5100? Moeka, you fool, you let your tongue slip!

Two weeks ago, FB told her to leave the IBN 5100 at a drop point. That means she already had it in her possession at that time.

I recall how Moeka kept bombarding me with questions about the IBN 5100. I might have let it slip that I found the computer at Yanabayashi Shrine.

After that, she sent her D-Mail.

The worldline changed.


The lock was broken on the shrine's storehouse door.

The IBN 5100 was gone.

These facts point to one conclusion.

She sent herself the location of the IBN 5100!

Now that I know, it seems so obvious.

If only I hadn't trusted Moeka. If only I had seen through her lies.

But no, I played right into her hands. I was the tool's tool.

I almost burst into self-deriding laughter.

But I desperately hold it back, and keep a straight face.

No, I can't expect it to still be there.

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
It's midnight, and Akiba is practically empty. The silence is eerie.


There's no sign of anyone near the coin locker.


Considering the IBN 5100's size, it couldn't fit in the regular-sized lockers.

She must have put it in one of the three large lockers on the right.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4466" mode="on">
"The light's on!"

The bottom locker is still in use.

Is the IBN 5100 inside?

My heart starts pounding in my chest. I feel my face grow hot with excitement.

We've been apart for far too long, my partner, but now only a thin locker door separates us.



Is this what love feels like?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4467" mode="on">
"...Let's not go crazy."

I force myself to consider the situation calmly.

Is the IBN 5100 really inside?

I want to check right this instant. I can't believe I forgot to ask Moeka which locker she used.

Should I get a crowbar or something to pry the locker open?

If the IBN 5100 really is inside, and I steal it, what will happen to the worldline?

I have yet to cancel all of the D-Mails, which I thought was the only way to restore the original worldline.



But now the IBN 5100's so close. Why can't I just reach out and take it?

I know how to cancel Moeka's D-Mail, so I can always do that if this doesn't work.

Let's try it, just to make sure.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
First, I make a quick visit to the lab.

Ignoring the complaints of the lab mems, who stayed awake in the lab all night, I retrieve a makeshift crowbar from the development room.


Then I return to the lockers and thrust the pointed tip of the crowbar into the crack of the door.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4468" mode="on">

Just as I begin to pry, a shrill siren shatters the night.

I look up to see the red lights of a patrol car coming this way.

Their timing couldn't be worse!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
The police release me after about thirty minutes of scolding.

I return to the coin locker and try to pry it open again. Immediately, another patrol car appears. This time, they take me to the police station.

I'm stuck in an interrogation room all night, getting preached to by policemen. I conclude that this is another effect of attractor field convergence.

No matter what I do, I cannot obtain an IBN 5100 on this worldline. That is what fate has decreed.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
I get the police to call my father, and they finally release me.

They didn't go so far as to arrest me, but the policemen, as well as my father, scold me harshly.

I act apologetic, but in actuality, their words fall on deaf ears.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
After my father goes home, I head straight to Moeka's apartment.

I tried calling her -- I took the opportunity to memorize her phone number yesterday -- but she wouldn't pick up at all.

Before I get there, I send a mail to Daru asking him to check if the coin locker is still occupied.

Moeka's face contorts again.

I'm being blunt. Not only because Moeka is Mayuri's murderer, but also because Moeka's weakness is starting to get on my nerves.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
Just like Daru's mail said, the locker is still occupied when I get there.

I look around to make sure there are no patrol cars.

No crowbars this time. I don't feel like getting arrested.


I head across the street to Daibiru, hide behind one of its humongous pillars, and begin the stakeout.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]

I was going to borrow Mayuri's portable game console, but I decided I didn't need the distraction.

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
Still, it's pretty tough to keep standing like this. I also need to stay inconspicuous.

<PRE @box00>[text00210]

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
I wouldn't want a security guard to give me trouble.

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
I mean, I guess there's not much worry about that. I've already been here for seven hours without incident.

<PRE @box00>[text00250]

I'd love to go get some food, but I can't take my eyes off the locker.

Now we can take turns watching, and we'll also look less suspicious to passersby.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00630]
The night draws on, and still no sign of FB.

We nap in one hour shifts, but it doesn't help the exhaustion.

On top of that, I don't have anyone to talk to -- Moeka can't keep a conversation going -- so there's nothing I can do to stave off boredom.

I went back to the lab to shower just before dawn, but Kurisu, who was working an all-nighter on the Time Leap Machine, just glared at me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
The wait finally ends at just after 1 PM on the 13th.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00650]
Someone comes to open the lower-right locker.

We watch from behind the pillar.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00660]
It's a nondescript middle-aged man.

He's dressed in a new suit, but it hangs rather poorly on him, as if he's not used to wearing it.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00670]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4489" mode="on">
"Is that FB?"

Moeka shakes her head firmly.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0423" mode="on">
"FB... is a woman."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4490" mode="on">
"So... maybe she hired someone to pick it up."

Or it could be someone from the locker company here to clear it after weeks overdue.

That would make us all idiots. Moeka, FB, and me.

The man has the key to the locker.

He pays the late fee with 100 yen coins, then removes the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.

The man thought ahead and brought a pushcart.

He puts the IBN 5100 onto the pushcart with a bit of effort, and begins walking away.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4491" mode="on">
"Follow him!"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00680]
The man heads straight for Akihabara Station.

Strangely enough, he walks up to an overweight man standing in front of the ticket machine.

The overweight man is wearing a T-shirt and has all the signs of an otaku. He doesn't seem to have anything in common with the first guy, who looks like an average salaryman.

They transfer the IBN 5100 into the overweight man's suitcase.

After they exchange a few words, the overweight man enters the station alone. Then the guy in the suit leaves.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4492" mode="on">
"Weird."

What was the purpose of that transfer?

Is the overweight man FB? Or is he just another link in some kind of chain?


At any rate, if we keep following the IBN 5100, we should reach FB eventually.

We enter the station.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00690]
The overweight man boards the Yamanote line. We board on the next car and keep watch through the connecting door.


It's a weekday afternoon, so there aren't many passengers.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00700]
Thirty minutes later, we arrive at Shinjuku Station.

Here, the train sees a sharp increase in passenger traffic.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00710]
<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0424" mode="on">
"He's getting off..."

Moeka pulls on my sleeve.

The overweight man has slipped into the stream of departing passengers. He's about to exit onto the platform.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00720]
We follow him, but due to our slow reaction, we have to push our way through the boarding passengers.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00730]
The train doors close, and it slowly departs.

The man starts walking towards the exit.


Shinjuku is crowded, so we have to follow close behind or we'll lose him.



But then I stop in my tracks.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4493" mode="on">
"Wha...!?"

The man is empty-handed.

His suitcase is missing.

What?

For a second, I think we followed the wrong man, but no, it's definitely him.

We watched him the whole time he was on the train.


There's no doubt he had the suitcase when the train arrived in Shinjuku.

Could he have passed it to someone else in this crowd?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4494" mode="on">
"Clever..."

<PRE @box00>[text00740]

<PRE @box00>[text00750]
I return to the lab and leap an hour back.

I find myself inside the train.

I know it's bad manners to use my phone on the train, but this is an emergency.

According to the train's display, we're about to leave Otsuka for Ikebukuro. Three stops to Shinjuku.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00760]
Moeka is next to me, acting inconspicuous.

I peek at the overweight man in the next car.

Moeka's eyes widen.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00780]
The train arrives at Shinjuku on schedule.

Just to make sure, I'll have Moeka follow the man when he gets off.

Before the doors open, I stealthily move to his car.

He still has the suitcase with the IBN 5100.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00790]
<voice name="Station　Announcer" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/KAN_0002" mode="on">

The doors open and passengers spew out.

The overweight man leaves too, just like last time. However...

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4499" mode="on">
"I knew it!"

He leaves the suitcase on the train.

And now, passengers from Shinjuku board.

Someone walks up to the abandoned suitcase. It's a woman in her 30s pushing a baby stroller.

There's no baby.

The woman casually loads the suitcase into her stroller and sits down.

After witnessing that scene, I return to the neighboring car.

I need to be careful. These guys are serious about avoiding pursuit.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00800]
The train starts moving.

I contact Moeka so we can regroup later.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00810]
After that incident, the package swaps couriers like a hot potato, snaking around the tracks that run through Tokyo like a web.


Whenever they give me the slip, I time leap and resume the chase.

Finally, the courier and package get aboard the Hibiya Line and return to Akihabara Station, where it all began.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00820]
I recognize the last courier.

He's one of the men who raided the lab with Moeka.

Dark skin. Crew cut. The one who hit me with his gun.

The man easily carries the 25-kilo package out of the station. We follow.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00830]
A car honks its horn.

Moeka and I immediately hide.

Peering out from cover, I see a white flatbed parked in front of the station.

A muscular man hops out of the driver's seat.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4500" mode="on">
"Wha..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00840]
I know that face.

No. It can't be!

I desperately try to organize my thoughts.

That's... Tennouji Yuugo, owner of the Braun Tube Workshop.

Mister Braun.

Why?

Why is he here?

Does this mean he's connected to FB? To the Rounders?

Was the Braun Tube Workshop just a front for SERN? Is that how he could afford to keep it open?

What's going on here!?


His shop is right below the lab. If he's working for the enemy, then...



I shiver at the thought.

Stop. Let's not rush to conclusions. He might just be another courier.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00850]
We watch from a distance. Tennouji takes the suitcase from the crew-cut man and loads it into the back seat of his car. Then he gets into the car alone and takes off toward Showa-dori.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00860]
I stare after it in disbelief.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00870]
I time leap several hours to before the first man arrived at the coin locker.


Then I explain the situation to Moeka. My plan is to get ahead of the package.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00880]
After killing some time at Starbecks, we rent a car.

I don't have a license, so Moeka's driving.

We go to the street in front of the roundabout, facing Showa-dori, and park near Yodobashi Camera. Now we wait.

I was surprised Moeka had a license in the first place. Apparently FB told her it would come in handy for her Rounder work.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00900]
I have Moeka wait in the car while I keep a lookout on the roundabout.

The white station wagon's already stopped there.

From this distance, I can clearly see Tennouji in the driver's seat.

Nobody else is riding.

The crew cut guy should arrive just after 5 PM.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00910]
As expected, the crew cut man arrives right on time, effortlessly dragging the suitcase behind him.


It feels weird seeing the exact same scene from a different angle.

I hurry back to the car, where Moeka's waiting.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4504" mode="on">
"He's coming!"

The station wagon rolls past us.

It takes a left turn at the Showa-dori intersection, towards Okachimachi.

Moeka smoothly sets the car in motion.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00920]
Finally, we arrive at Tennouji's house in Okachimachi.




This is the house where Suzuha lived. Her rusty old mountain bike is still sitting out front.

Tennouji brings the IBN 5100 inside.

We stop a little farther down the road and keep watch.

Is he FB? Does he know FB?

Moeka insists that FB is a woman.

So maybe it's Tennouji's wife, whom I've never met.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00940]
I have Moeka show me one of FB's mails.

<PRE @box00>[text00950]

Moeka's a mailing machine. She sent FB nearly 10 mails a day, but FB replied to every single one.

You'd have to be a saint to reply to all those emails. No wonder Moeka was so dependent on FB.

The next day, Tennouji goes to work on his moped like usual. He returns after sunset.

There's no sign of his daughter, Nae, or his wife.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00990]
Something finally happens early Sunday morning.

Just before 3 AM, six people show up at Tennouji's house.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4507" mode="on">

It's dark, but I recognize them.

Moeka doesn't show much of a reaction.

I thought she knew them.

I ask, but she says she's never met them before.

It looks like this worldline's Moeka has been cut off completely.

Were they done with her once she found them an IBN 5100?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01020]
Tennouji comes outside and loads the IBN 5100 into the station wagon.


Then the six men get in and drive away.

Tennouji sees them off, then goes back inside his house.

<PRE @box00>[text01030]
<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0436" mode="on">

I'm interested in Tennouji's story, but the IBN 5100 will lead us to FB.

We decide to follow the station wagon.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text01040]
The pursuit ends at Narita International Airport.

The six men, IBN 5100 in tow, board a plane headed for France.

France. SERN's home country.


What does this mean?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4508" mode="on">
"Tennouji's wife might be FB."


Since there's been no sign of FB this far, she must be an extremely cautious individual. But the evidence suggests only one possibility.

On worldline Alpha 1, Moeka's men attacked the night the Time Leap Machine was completed. Their timing was perfect.

It makes sense if you assume that Tennouji is closely linked to FB. He was right downstairs the whole time we were discussing our plans. FB knew exactly what we were up to.

We were dancing to her tune all along.

When we get back to Akiba, Moeka and I start walking towards Tennouji's house.

But on the way, I get an angry call from Kurisu demanding an update, so I decide to take care of that first.

Kiryu Moeka.

This afternoon, she kills herself.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
I've already told Moeka her fate.

But in spite of that, Moeka doesn't seem upset -- at least on the surface. She's expressionless as always. The only difference is that she's not checking her phone as often.

But Moeka's not a strong woman.

Beneath that expressionless mask, is she struggling against the fear of death?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
I decide to confront Tennouji directly.

I have Kurisu stand guard outside the house while Moeka and I go inside.

Not that we're planning to break in. We ring the doorbell like honest citizens.

Tennouji soon opens the door and invites us into the living room.

I'm more interested in his wife. There's still no sign of her.


Is she asleep too? Or could she be hiding somewhere?


I'd like to do a thorough search of the house, but of course that's impossible.

And then there's what he said just now about seeing Nae off to school.

That sounded like something a single father would say.

I suspected that FB was Tennouji's wife, but that may have been a mistake.


Maybe Tennouji is just another courier after all. Maybe he doesn't even know about FB.

There's the possibility that FB might not even be in Akiba.

I need answers.

But how do I get them?

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Moeka is just staring at the floor.

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
And whether or not Tennouji's wife is FB, I don't think this man will fall for any tricks.

I decide to go for the direct approach.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4522" mode="on">
"A few hours ago, six men stopped by this house to pick up a package, which they then delivered to France. You were there. I saw you."

This time, Tennouji doesn't give me his usual macho attitude. He just smiles softly.

Tennouji casually produces a handgun. The motion is so smooth and natural that I don't even recognize it as a gun at first.



Its heavy form gives off a chilling black luster.

The muzzle is pointed at Moeka.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4527" mode="on">

Moeka and I are unarmed. We didn't plan for this!

We're at an overwhelming disadvantage. I was a fool to believe the direct approach would work.

Now my recklessness is going to get both of us killed.

...No, not both of us. I don't die here.





I'm here because I time leap on the 16th. That fact is written on the fabric of this worldline.

At the beginning of all this, Moeka killed Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00430]
But now Moeka lies dead, while Mayuri still lives.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00440]
All because I changed the past.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00450]
Moeka. If you're going to apologize for a sin you didn't commit, then I must apologize as well.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00470]
I am responsible for twisting your fate.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00480]
...And for twisting the fate of Tennouji Nae.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00490]
I ruined that innocent girl's life, made her something other than what she was meant to be.



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00510]
Is it okay to just leave her like this?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00520]
Of course, if I send the D-Mail now, this worldline will be undone.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00530]
Nae's twisted fate will be corrected.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00540]
There's no point in worrying about it.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00550]
I should just think about Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00560]
I shouldn't burden myself with any more problems.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00570]
...Is this really okay?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00580]
Of course it is.

Send the D-Mail.

That's all I need to do.

Why won't my fingers move?

I already know what I need to do!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00590]
And yet...!

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00600]
The world warps.

Once the distortion dissipates, Kurisu is gone. So is Moeka's body.

The phone I'm gripping is my own. FB's phone has disappeared.

I look at my hands. They're clean. No blood.

No knife on the floor either.

Everything was undone.

But... then why am I in this room?


There are two bottles of Dr P on the coffee table.

Both are open.

One is nearly empty, but the other is still full.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00610]
I jump at the sound of a running shower.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00620]
After a few minutes, Moeka comes out of the bathroom, expressionless.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4574" mode="on">
"...You're alive."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0468" mode="on">
"...?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00630]
Moeka sits down on the tatami mats, not questioning why I'm here.

She takes out her purple phone and begins typing a mail.

It feels like forever since I've seen her lightning-speed typing.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
This mail doesn't make sense.

It reads like Moeka and I were discussing the IBN 5100 just moments ago.

...Of course. That's exactly what happened on this worldline.

That explains why I'm here.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00650]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4575" mode="on">

So FB's still alive.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00690]
I feel relief, but also fear. I mustn't forget that he is my enemy.


For now, however, I'm more interested in what Moeka just said.

I cover my ears.

I can't get that childish, yet hate-filled voice out of my head.

On that worldline, I turned an innocent girl into a murderer.

I bite my lip hard, hard enough to draw blood.

That worldline has already been undone.

But how will things turn out on this new worldline?

No, there's no point thinking about it.

If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should already be back in my possession.

And if that's the case...

Then there's no need to stay on this worldline, either.

"Huh?"

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2454" mode="on">
"Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?"

After time leaping four hours back, I find myself in front of the station.


This is right after Moeka and I met up with Kurisu after returning from Narita Airport.

After this comes the Tennouji residence.

Moeka is standing a few meters away, kicking the dirt in boredom.


Moeka was dead just a few minutes ago, but now she's perfectly fine.

I feel no surprise. I suppose I've grown accustomed to this particular facet of time travel.


After all, I've seen Mayuri come back to life countless times already.

There is one other thing experience has taught me.

Today, Moeka and Tennouji will die, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.

I know it's cruel, but I didn't come back here to save them.

I don't have the means to, and it isn't my problem.

The problem is Nae.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
We arrive in front of Tennouji's house, just like we did before I time leaped.

But this time, I wait outside with Kurisu.

Moeka enters alone, expressionless as ever.

While we wait outside, I tell Kurisu what's about to happen.

I also tell her to wait a little while after she hears the gunshot, and then go inside and take Tennouji's phone.

It feels like an eternity passes in silence.

And then...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2455" mode="on">
"...!"

Kurisu gasps. Her body goes stiff.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2456" mode="on">
"There really was a gunshot..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
I immediately look around.

Just as Kurisu told me, I see a girl come out of the window.

She walks away quickly, but at the same time taking care not to make a sound.

That's not how a child acts after witnessing her father's death.



<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4584" mode="on">
"Wait!"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
Nae looks over her shoulder.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
She spears me with eyes full of hatred.

That alone is enough to make me shiver.

It's pitiful, but a tiny little girl is making me nervous.

Something is very wrong here.


This Nae is like a completely different person.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
I want to know her true identity.

That's why I time leaped instead of sending the D-Mail.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
Nae is still running, ignoring my calls to stop.

I run after her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
Out of shape though I may be, I'm still more than a match for a 12-year-old girl.

The distance between us quickly shortens.

Nae keeps running, occasionally looking back at me and grinding her teeth in a very un-childlike manner.


Normally, a child being chased by a man will cry and scream things like "Stay away!" or "Help!" 

But this girl says nothing. The only sound is her heavy breathing.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4585" mode="on">
"Stop!"

I call out to her once more when she's nearly in arm's reach.

Unexpectedly, Nae slows down, and eventually stops to catch her breath.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
<voice name="Nae" class="VID_NAE" src="voice/MAR_0065" mode="on">
"...haah... ...ha ...ah..."

Looks like she's realized she can't get away.

From the sound of her breathing, she must be at her limit.

We're alone. Kurisu and Moeka must still be at the house, and the streets are empty thanks to the Obon holidays.


Perfect. I was afraid someone might report me as a child molester. Now I can get what I need to know out of this strange girl who looks like Nae.

I call out to her as I catch my breath.

<voice name="Nae" class="VID_NAE" src="voice/MAR_0074" mode="on">

<voice name="Nae" class="VID_NAE" src="voice/MAR_0075" mode="on">
"I'll kill you in fifteen years. Keep living in fear until then."

I get on my knees and grab Nae by the shoulders.

And yet, this girl doesn't even flinch.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4592" mode="on">

So that was Nae's final time leap!

Will her revenge be complete then?

Or will it continue forever, until even she forgets why?

Does time travel bring nothing but pain?

We built a time machine out of curiosity.

We were fools.


If not for our meddling, SERN would not have targeted us.

Mayuri would not have died.

Suzuha would not have had to travel to the past.

Any Rounder who finds an IBN 5100 is silenced. No exceptions.

That's what Tennouji said.

In that case, the one who should have been eliminated first was Moeka. She found the IBN 5100 in the first place.

And yet, Tennouji cut contact with her instead.

And when we exposed his true identity, he shot himself, not Moeka.

"I think... I think he wanted to save Moeka."

Perhaps that's just wishful thinking.

Perhaps I'm just looking for an ounce of comfort in all this suffering.

Even if that was Tennouji's intention, it was meaningless. Moeka will die today. Whether by her own hand or Nae's, it doesn't matter.

However...

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4609" mode="on">

I bite my lip hard, hard enough to draw blood.

I won't fear you, Nae. Nor will I repent.

That worldline has already been undone.

But... how will things turn out on this new worldline?

No, there's no point thinking about it.

If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should already be back in my possession.

And if that's the case...

Then there's no need to stay on this worldline, either.

I was right. I had missed something vital... something <I>dire</i>⑰.

The worldline I set my sights on to save Mayuri.

The worldline upon which Suzuha staked her hope for the future.

The worldline I am at last poised to reach at the end of this long struggle.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00650]
On that worldline, Mayuri lives.

I thought that I had found the solution, that everything would be alright.

But the equation was meaningless. I had solved nothing.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
Instead, I am left with a terrible choice.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
Or Kurisu.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
One of them must die.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Radio Kaikan is still off limits.

They haven't yet repaired the hole that Suzuha's time machine made.

I look down through the hole at the streets of Akiba.

From up here, they look narrow and stifling.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
Across the way, a train rumbles by. I watch the yellow-striped cars move past.

I came here because I wanted to be alone.

The day before yesterday, I abruptly canceled the attempt to hack SERN.

Kurisu and Daru demanded an explanation, but I just couldn't give them one.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
The decision has paralyzed me.

Two days later, I am still nowhere close to finding an answer.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4657" mode="on">
"..."

What do I do?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Two weeks ago, on July 28th, Doctor Nakabachi held a press conference in this very spot.

The same day, Kurisu was murdered.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
Let's say we go through with the plan and delete the first D-Mail I sent -- the one about Kurisu's death -- from SERN's database.

That would return us to the Beta worldline, where it all began. What would happen then?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
According to my predictions, our friend, Lab Member 004...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
Makise Kurisu would disappear.

Someone who died on July 28th cannot be alive now, on August 15th. That would defy causality.

A time paradox.

That worldline has already rejected her existence.

The moment we erase the D-Mail, Kurisu will cease to exist.


And so, I am left with two options.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
Option One. Hack SERN with the IBN 5100 and erase the first D-Mail I sent, thus returning to the Beta worldline.

Kurisu will disappear, but Mayuri will live. SERN will never build a time machine, and the future will be free.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00140]
Option Two. Don't hack SERN. Keep living here on the Alpha worldline.

Mayuri will die. So will Moeka and FB.

Kurisu will likely be kidnapped by SERN, but at the very least, she won't die.

With her research, SERN will gain control of space-time, and the future will be a dystopia where no one is free.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4658" mode="on">
"And I'm supposed to choose?"

Ridiculous.




I choke out a laugh.

How am I, of all people, supposed to make that choice?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4659" mode="on">
"There's no way..."

I don't really care about the future, whether it's free or ruled by SERN.

I know I should care. Suzuha entrusted her wish to me. Doesn't that make it my responsibility?

But still, it doesn't seem quite real. Twenty years is a long time.

Right now, only Mayuri and Kurisu matter. I must choose which to save.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
If I had been given this choice back on July 28th, before this all started...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
I probably would not have hesitated to abandon Kurisu and save Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
But it's not July 28th. It's August 15th.



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
I've spent two long weeks with Kurisu. She's one of us now, an integral part of the lab.

And as I leapt through time again and again, she was the person I relied on most.

Always calm. Always thoughtful. Always ready with a new hypothesis. Always there to give me a push when I needed it most.

I wouldn't even have the Time Leap Machine if not for Kurisu. It's thanks to her that I made it this far.

After all she's done for me, there's no way I can abandon her now.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
But nor can I let Mayuri die.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
Everything I've done, I did to save her.

I would give anything, even my own life, to see her safe.


More than anything, I want her to live.

No matter what, I won't let her die.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4660" mode="on">

Is there no other option? No way to save them both?


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
What if I use Suzuha's time machine?

I could return to the Beta worldline, then use her time machine to travel to July 28th.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00260]
No, that won't work.

The reason Suzuha leapt to 2010 was to prevent SERN from creating a dystopia. That only occurs on this worldline.


On the Beta worldline, she'll have no reason to leap to 2010. Suzuha's time machine won't exist, so I won't be able to use it.

Alright. Then what if I send Kurisu a warning via D-Mail?

It could say, "Don't go to Doctor Nakabachi's presentation."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00270]
No, that won't work either.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
Remember, causality converges.

Kurisu's death is inevitable on the Beta worldline, just as Mayuri's is inevitable on this worldline.

No matter what I do, fate will ensure her death.



<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4663" mode="on">
"There's no way..."

I slowly sink to the floor with my back against the fence.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4664" mode="on">
"I... can't save her."

I'm powerless against the will of fate.


What should I do?

What should I do!?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4665" mode="on">
"..."

Maybe...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00300]
Maybe Mayuri doesn't die on the current worldline.

I canceled Moeka's D-Mail. Plus, I haven't had an opportunity to check the divergence meter since.

Might there be a chance?

If the pattern continues, Mayuri's death has been pushed back to the night of the 17th.

If Mayuri doesn't die between 7 and 8 PM that night...

Then I won't have to face this horrible decision.

I know it's unlikely. I understand that from all my experiences so far.

But still, I can't help but cling to that hope.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00310]
Mayuri and Kurisu.

If I can just save them both...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00320]
Then I don't care if the future is ruled by SERN.

I'll betray Suzuha's dream, if that's what it takes.

So please, let Mayuri live!



To whom should I make this desperate plea?

God?

Fate?

The universe itself?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00330]
Either way, I am just one insignificant human among billions. Will my prayers truly reach?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00340]
I already know what the answer will be.

And that knowledge, that <I>certainty</i>⑰, is despair.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00350]
ComiMa runs for three straight days, from the 15th to the 17th.


On the last day, I go with Mayuri and stay with her from morning until ComiMa closes.


It's not really my thing, though, and the crowd is ridiculous, so I wait off to the side with Mayuri's bags. From time to time, Mayuri appears with new bags for me to guard, and usually a snack for us to share, but most of the day I spend alone.

To some extent, I'm here to escape reality -- to empty my mind and forget my fears.

But even when I close my eyes, I can still hear the footsteps of death approaching.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00360]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1223" mode="on">
"Haah, we're finally home♪"

It's already dark by the time the bus drops us back at Akiba.

Mayuri is dragging her costume case behind her.

I'm carrying bags covered in moe artwork and loaded with doujinshi.

These are all Mayuri's purchases, not mine.

I can't believe she bought so much. I guess the reason she doesn't cosplay herself is that she's too busy shopping.


We get off the bus and just stand there for a while.

Maybe Mayuri wants a taste of normalcy again, now that the chaos of ComiMa has ended.

I can't begrudge her that.

A downhearted frown replaces the usual smile on Mayuri's face.

But it's not like I could tell her the truth.

We arrive at the lab.

I look up at the second floor, but there's no light in the window.

Oddly enough, there's nobody here today.

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Is Moeka going to ambush us?

On the previous worldline, I forgave Moeka and Tennouji.

But that has already been undone.

This is a new worldline. The Rounders are still alive, and they're still after the Time Leap Machine.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4681" mode="on">
"Wait here, Mayuri."

I motion for her to sit and wait on the bench in front. Then I carefully check the area.

I know my efforts are likely futile.

But still, I want to do anything I can. Anything to give Mayuri a chance, however small, of surviving on this worldline.

Something tells me it would be foolish to go straight up to the lab.

So first, I decide to check the street for any suspicious people.

I walk down the street towards Kuramaebashi-dori, careful to always keep Mayuri in sight.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4683" mode="on">
"Wha..."

I can see clearly through the front window. The man in the driver's seat is unfamiliar.



But I have seen that station wagon before.

It's the same one Moeka used to run us over on a previous worldline.

The same one Tennouji used to transport the IBN 5100.

And now it's bearing down on me at full speed.

I can't move. It's all happening too fast.

I expected an ambush inside the lab. Instead, I'm facing a charging car.



What do I do!?

I'm fine. I won't die. This worldline hasn't approved that fate.

No, wait. What day is it?

This is the first time I've made it to the 17th. Does that mean my death is still undecided?



Will I die in Mayuri's place?

If that will save her... if that will end this... then maybe it's for the best.

No! I don't want to die yet!

Two contradictory emotions collide in my mind. My body doesn't know which way to turn.

But that is no longer an option, now that I've confirmed Mayuri's death.

This time, I need to reach a decision.

But how? This equation has no solution.

No matter what choice I make, someone dies.

From a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I should choose the Beta worldline, where SERN never creates a dystopia.

But it's not that simple. Not for me.

There must be some other way.

According to Suzuha, 2010 is a point of great divergence at the attractor field level.


I think that divergence had already commenced by the time I sent the D-Mail reporting Kurisu's death.

So when <I>did</i>⑰ divergence begin?

I can't say for sure, but I think it was the moment we completed the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

That was around the middle of July. Daru and I deemed it a failure right after completion.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
By the time Kurisu was killed, there was already a huge divergence at the attractor field level.

Now that I think about it, Reading Steiner activated that day, when I sent the D-Mail that started it all.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
At that moment, every pedestrian and vehicle on the main street of Akiba suddenly vanished.


That feels so long ago.

But now, I can finally explain it.

That was the moment I moved to the Alpha worldline.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
On the Beta worldline, where this all began, Suzuha didn't arrive in her time machine. Doctor Nakabachi's conference went ahead as planned, and the flow of tourists and shoppers through Akiba was unimpeded.



But when I sent the D-Mail, events changed on a huge scale. From my perspective, at least.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
On the current worldline, Suzuha crashed her time machine into the roof of Radio Kaikan. Nakabachi's presentation was canceled, and this part of Akiba was closed to traffic.


Because I was out on the street when the worldline changed, it appeared to me as if thousands of people suddenly vanished.

The truth is that they were never there to begin with.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
Like a magician's trick, it's so obvious once you understand how it works.

The real problem is the timing of the D-Mail.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I moved to the Alpha worldline after Kurisu died.

If I had sent the D-Mail <i>before</i>⑰ she died, then I might have been able to intervene, even now, on this worldline.

But no, that would defy causality. I sent that D-Mail because I saw Kurisu's body. That's the way it has to be.



Who killed her anyway? I still don't know.

It definitely wasn't suicide.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
What if I identify the murderer and send them a D-Mail warning them off? Would that prevent her death?

I mean, no one has tried to kill her on this worldline, have they? Maybe there's a chance.

However, to send that D-Mail, I would first have to move to the Beta worldline.

...The more I think about it, the more futile it seems.

Ultimately, we would never have built the Time Leap Machine, leaving me without the means to save Mayuri.

She's right. Even if I don't tell Mayuri the truth, I need to at least tell her <i>something</i>⑰.

I'll postpone my decision, and go see Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
It's afternoon on the first day of ComiMa, and the crowds are finally beginning to thin out.

Of course, the industry booths and cosplay area are still packed, but at least I don't have to wait in line to get in.

I've been trying to get in touch with Mayuri for a while now, but she hasn't responded.

I checked with Daru, but he hasn't seen her today either.


Cosplay ends at 4 PM. I focus on searching the cosplay area until then, but I still can't find her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
Maybe she finished early and went home.

I try calling her home. No luck. They haven't seen her since she left this morning.

Where is she?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
I'm always afraid that she'll disappear the second I take my eyes off of her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
It's been like that ever since she lost her grandmother. 





Maybe it's just my imagination.

We've been so close for so long. I saw Mayuri at her weakest and most vulnerable.

Maybe that has made me overprotective.



But I don't care how other people see us.

I just can't leave Mayuri alone.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
I step into the cemetery.

The final resting place of Mayuri's beloved grandmother.

When was the last time I came here?

For about a year after Mayuri became my "hostage," I'd periodically accompany her here.

But I don't think I've been here since I entered high school. So it's been about three or four years.

As I get closer to Mayuri's grandmother's grave, I begin to hear a voice.

It's Mayuri. I'd recognize her voice anywhere.

It sounds like she's talking to someone.

I approach quietly.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1268" mode="on">
"Hey, Granny."

Mayuri is standing there, talking to the grave.

What a relief. She hasn't disappeared.

I decide to watch silently from a short distance away.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1269" mode="on">
"I've been having scary dreams lately."

For a second, I wonder if she's learned to commune with the dead, but no, she's just talking to herself.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1270" mode="on">
"In my dreams, bad things keep happening to me."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1271" mode="on">
"Like someone shoots me, or a car hits me, or I get run over by a train..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
...What?

Don't tell me...

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1272" mode="on">
"It's so real. It hurts so much, and I feel so sad, and I try to call for help but nothing comes out..."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1273" mode="on">
"Why do you think I'm having these dreams?"

Does she... remember her deaths? <I>All of them?</i>⑰

Is she inheriting memories like I do?

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1274" mode="on">
"And you know, they always end the same way..."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1275" mode="on">

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1276" mode="on">

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
Both Faris and Lukako remembered their memories from before the past changed.

I used to think that memories couldn't be shared between worldlines.

I used to think that I was the exception, with Reading Steiner.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00090]
But maybe that's not the case.

Maybe everyone has the same power, and the only difference is how strong it is.

Maybe Reading Steiner is nothing special after all.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1278" mode="on">
"That makes Mayushii even more sad. I try to say 'sorry, sorry,' but he still can't hear."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1279" mode="on">
"And that's when I wake up."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1280" mode="on">
"Why am I having these dreams?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00100]
I've failed so many times to save her.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00110]
I've watched her die again and again.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00120]
Everything I've done has been to prevent that from happening.

And yet, have the memories of those deaths been tormenting her as she sleeps?

I bite my lip in frustration.

I still have a terrible decision to make.

Do I save Mayuri? Or do I save Kurisu?

There's no perfect ending here. I can't save them both.

It's one... or the other.

If I choose Kurisu, then Mayuri's dreams will become reality.

I don't want Mayuri to feel any pain.

Until now, I've thought only of saving her.

That is my goal.

But at the same time, I can't let Kurisu die.

Again, my thoughts hit the same dead end.

Mayuri hasn't noticed me yet. She's still staring at the sky, just as she was on the day I took her "hostage."

She's talking to her grandmother in heaven.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1281" mode="on">
"Oh, right! We have a lot more lab mems now, you know!"

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1282" mode="on">

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1283" mode="on">
"That makes eight of us. It's really amazing."

On this worldline, they all became lab mems. However, not a single one of them has sent a D-Mail.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1284" mode="on">
"You know, it was just Okarin and Mayushii at first."

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1285" mode="on">

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1286" mode="on">
"But now, he's having so much fun."

Is that how she sees it?

Well... she's not wrong.

She really does know me, doesn't she.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1287" mode="on">
"And that makes Mayushii happy too!"

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1288" mode="on">

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1291" mode="on">
"She even made a time machine! Oh, but can't forget Okarin and Daru-kun helped too."

Then Mayuri falls silent.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00130]
Her gaze becomes distant.

She stands still, and looks up to the sky.

What could she be thinking?

After I escorted Mayuri home from the cemetery, I spent the whole night wracking my brain for a third option, a way out of this mess.

My thoughts were a jumble, ideas coming and going too fast to judge which were right and which were wrong.

But of course, there isn't a right choice here.

For in the end, it always comes back to the same question. Who do I let die?

And no matter how I try to dance around it, the answer is always the same.

I can't choose.

Is there no one else who can make this decision?

No. Even if there were, I know I'd never accept their choice. Whichever it happened to be.

I thought that I was alone, but someone was here before me.

Kurisu is lying in the middle of the roof, arms and legs spread as if making a snow angel.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
The image of Kurisu in a pool of blood flashes through my mind.

Is she alright!?

I run towards her, but before I make it halfway, she suddenly sits up and turns to face me.

What a dumb thing to say.

Fortunately, it looks like Kurisu didn't hear me. She's busy combing her disheveled hair with her fingers.

I breathe a silent sigh of relief.

I don't know what to say, so I keep my mouth shut.

Kurisu appears to be in the same boat. She's staring at the capsule toy dispenser in the corner, her face wearing the usual frown.

The awkward silence drags on.

When you think about it, Kurisu's fate rests in my hands.

My decision will determine whether she lives or dies.

Her fantastic hypothesis yesterday was a desperate attempt to construct a scenario where she doesn't die.

Even if she believes that her theory is correct, it must be difficult for her to avoid imagining her own death.

I force a smile. I'm getting really uncomfortable here.

When I look up, raindrops start landing on my forehead.

An evening shower. It's only going to get more intense, and quickly.

Kurisu hasn't moved a muscle.

She's just standing there with her arms folded, staring at the ground as if she doesn't notice the rain at all.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2651" mode="on">
"It's because of these wet clothes! This sucks."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2652" mode="on">
"Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It's nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions."

Now she's talking to herself in an angry tone.

Kurisu has always been calm when faced with the unknown. I admired her for that.



I thought she was facing this calmly too.

But I was wrong.

Behind her cool facade, she was struggling to cope with the knowledge that her very existence was in jeopardy.

She was fighting that fear all alone, and now it has finally come to the surface.



Of course she's afraid.

However brilliant she may be, she's still just an 18-year-old girl.

I realize that I no longer hear the sound of rain pounding on the roof.

And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose.

Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back.

Despite her fear, Kurisu has made her choice.

It's time for me to do the same.

The future of the world.

Which friend to let die.

Holding Kurisu tightly, I whisper into her ear...

I hang my head and shut my eyes.

Kurisu's footsteps fade into the distance.

I wrap my arms around my body.


Even though it's summer and sweltering hot, I can't stop my body from shaking.




I realize that part of me is relieved that Kurisu left alone. At least I won't have to face her again, to look upon the face of the girl I chose to die.

I'm a coward.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4818" mode="on">
"Heh... heh heh heh..."

My self-loathing echoes in the darkness.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
I wait about two hours before returning to the lab. Kurisu is already gone when I get there.

All she left is a single email.

I sit down on the sofa. While drying my hair with a towel, I look towards the PC in the corner of the room.

It's already connected to the IBN 5100, ready for Daru to start hacking.

I already got in touch with him. The hacking starts tomorrow at noon.


I drove myself even further into a corner by telling that to Daru. Now I can't turn back, no matter how much I want to.

I chose Mayuri.

I will let Kurisu die.

Showering didn't soften the wrenching pain in my heart.

In truth, I'm just riding on Kurisu's resolve. Mine is still a flimsy thing.

I can't help but wonder, is this really okay?

Mayuri and Daru turn to me and nod.

Today is the last day of ComiMa. Daru wanted to attend, of course, but a little begging convinced him to prioritize the operation.

I take a look around the lab.


These twenty days have seen constant change. It's incredible to think that at one point, this lab had a whole eight members.

And now we're back to three.

The memories we made.

The experiences we shared.

To save Mayuri, I will undo them all.

There is sorrow in me. And guilt.


I engrave them deep inside my heart.

I'll never forget -- I mustn't forget -- these long, yet short summer days.

But still, I choose to erase our memories. I choose to return everything to normal.

Suzuha's mission is irrelevant. I'm not doing this for the future.

As long as Mayuri lives, nothing else matters.

Daru starts typing on the IBN 5100. It's already connected to his main computer.


This will get us into SERN's central database, where they keep the data they mine with Echelon.



There we will locate the first D-Mail I sent on July 28th, and erase all trace of its existence.

With this, I can reach the Beta worldline.

At last, Mayuri will be safe.

I look at Mayuri. She's on the couch, sitting straight as a ramrod, with her grandmother's pocket watch pressed to her ear. She stays still, with her eyes closed.

Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she listens to the sound of that pocket watch.

Ever since we parted with Kurisu, Mayuri has said nothing about my choice.

I guess she's come to terms with it, in her own way.

The actual work, I've left to Daru. No problem there.

While waiting for him to finish, I walk into the development room.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
In the center of the room is the Time Leap Machine.

I squat down and gently brush my fingers against the microwave's surface.

It's cool to the touch.

I've made irreplaceable friends because of this thing. And because of this thing, I've hurt them.

But I don't want to blame the tool.

It's how you use the tool that matters.

And I've got to admit, it's saved me more than once.


But still.

Once this is over, I'll destroy the Time Leap Machine.

We must never make the same mistakes again.

My name is there, followed by the message I wrote about Kurisu's death.

Three lines total, each twelve characters long.


This data led SERN to our doorstep.

At FB's instruction, Moeka and the Rounders attacked.

If Suzuha is right, then by erasing this data, we will escape from Attractor Field Alpha, where SERN dominates the future.


That will take us to Attractor Field Beta.

To the Beta worldline within its range of convergence.

To a future without Mayuri's death.

The night of the 17th passed. The night of the 18th passed. And Mayuri still didn't die.

I've kept a close watch for three days since then. There have been no attacks, no accidents, no sign that anything might happen. That was enough to convince me that Mayuri is safe.


Together with Daru, I destroyed the PhoneWave and the IBN 5100.

Although we have lost the ability to send D-Mails, that is a small price to pay to stay below SERN's radar.


Tennouji is downstairs in the Braun Tube Workshop, watching TV on the 42-inch CRT, like always.


When I went to check out Radio Kaikan, I found it open for business as usual.

A search of the internet turned up no mention of a satellite crash.

Instead, I found a small article in the local section of a newspaper dated July 28th.



It was a report on Kurisu's murder.

There was no follow-up. The culprit is still at large.


According to Daru, the police questioned me several times. It was I who discovered the body, after all.

Of course, I don't remember any of that.

At any rate, Mayuri is still alive.

I've accomplished what I set out to do.

It's over.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_1420" mode="on">
"Okarin♪"

Mayuri emerges from the ticket gate, waving her hand as she runs my way.

She weaves through the gaps between shoppers and maids handing out leaflets. And when she gets to me, she looks at me with puppy-dog eyes.

Mayuri doesn't answer me. She just strokes my cheek. Gently. Silently.

She's crying, but she doesn't seem sad. Rather, she seems overcome with emotion.

I have no idea how to respond to such an embarrassing question.

But she's right. Mayuri and I are officially a couple.

After these long, painful twenty days, I finally noticed how important Mayuri is to me. Plus, she told me that she loved me.

It's Sunday.

Despite the heat, I see plenty of shoppers laden with bags enjoying themselves on the streets of Akiba.

I suddenly feel a void in my heart.

Nothing about this town has changed.

Yet it feels like something is missing from my life.


No doubt it's the gap that was left by Kurisu.

But there's no such thing as a perfect future.

That is a fantasy that nobody can realize.

I mustn't forget.

This is the future I wished for, fought for, and won.

I have what is most important to me. Mayuri.

I should be thankful for that.

I am blessed far beyond the common man.

She's gone.

She's always like this.

Sometimes she just wanders off.

Mayuri promised she would never leave me.

This worldline is worthless without her.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4899" mode="on">

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00150]
Kurisu disappears down the stairs, muttering insults until I can no longer hear her.

Now alone, I sigh into the darkness.

Kurisu is absolutely right.

I can't think of a single way to save them both.

I'm a fool.

And yet, I have to try.

But this time, I won't have Kurisu's help.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00160]
I have to fight the universe alone.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00170]
How do I save both Kurisu and Mayuri?

I can't use D-Mail. Too much could go wrong.

I don't want to make the same mistakes again.


In the end, all I can do is time leap.

Time leaping can't save Mayuri, but at least it can delay her death, give me time to find a solution.

On this worldline, Mayuri dies at half past seven on the night of August 17th.

That's about 26 hours from now.

My battle has no end in sight.

If only Suzuha were here, I could have asked her for advice.

But even alone, I must find a way.

So resolved, I start time leaping again to save Mayuri.



I've done this before. When Mayuri died the first time at Moeka's hands, I tried time leaping to prevent her death.

But I only tried running away that time. This time, I try every approach I can think of.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00180]
I try hiring bodyguards to protect Mayuri.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00190]
I try taking Mayuri to South America -- an entire world away from Japan.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
I try crippling SERN with attacks on their servers, the ones that don't need the IBN 5100.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
I try getting Mayuri admitted to a hospital. It's hard, given Mayuri's perfect health, but I manage. My goal is to keep her from dying by heart attack.

I try everything I can possibly imagine.

However.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
Every plan fails.

Mayuri dies, again and again and again.

Sometimes it's murder, sometimes an accident.

But every time I leap, Mayuri dies.

Maybe it really is impossible to resist fate.

As long as I remain on this worldline, Mayuri can't be saved.

Fate will kill her every time.

From Mayuri's perspective, she only dies once.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
But I have seen her die dozens of times.

All because of me.

And yet, it no longer affects me as it used to.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00240]
Little by little, I have grown desensitized to her death.


In the beginning, I felt unbearable pain every time I saw her die, and murderous rage towards the ones responsible. Now I feel nothing.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
The realization stuns me.

After dozens of leaps, I finally realize what should have been obvious from the beginning -- I never leap back more than 26 hours.


Why?

I could go back as far as August 11th -- one whole week in the past.

Yet I never do.

Why?


Because I know that even if I do, nothing will change.

I <i>don't believe</i>⑰ that anything will change.

Every time Mayuri dies, I find myself thinking, "Another failure. What went wrong this time?"




I calmly analyze Mayuri's death, then take my data and head for the Time Leap Machine with a sigh, like a gamer forced for the umpteenth time to restart a particularly difficult stage.




I'm just going through the motions. I didn't even realize, until this moment, how routine it had all become.

Now that I have, my actions suddenly seem meaningless.

I can't take another step.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00260]
And that's how I find myself here, sitting motionless in front of the Time Leap Machine. I've been staring at it for hours.

When we got caught in that evening shower on the Radio Kaikan rooftop, my clothes got soaked. But now they're completely dry.

My body temperature has dropped, but I don't have the energy to warm myself with a shower.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00270]
I sluggishly get to my feet and pick up the headset.

The sight of it fills me with resignation.

Resignation. That's all.

There is no desperate drive to save Mayuri, no hope that this time I might succeed.

Those emotions are long gone.

In truth, they have been gone since my argument with Kurisu. Deep down, I always knew that she was right.

I pretended not to see it. I told myself that the Time Leap Machine could solve everything. 

But that was just an excuse, a last attempt to satisfy my ego.

In the end, all I'm doing is--

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2712" mode="on">
"Running away?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
I turn around in surprise, and there I see Kurisu standing in the doorway.

I thought she never wanted to see me again.

Why is she here?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4920" mode="on">
"Why..."

<PRE @box00>[text00290]

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4921" mode="on">
"..."

You don't have to tell me. I already know.

I know all too well.

In the end, all I'm doing is running away. Running from responsibility. Running from the decision.

If I had known I would have to make this choice, then I would have refused Suzuha when she entrusted me with her mission.

She's right. I have no other options left.

As long as I stay on this worldline, Mayuri will die.


And if I go to the Beta worldline, Kurisu will die.

So much has happened these past twenty days.

We argued. We exchanged insults.

<PRE @box00>[text00430]
We made incredible discoveries together, and when confronted with the implications, we shared our fears.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00440]
Whenever I hit a dead end in my struggle to save Mayuri, I always turned to Kurisu for help. She always listened. She always believed me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00450]
And I helped her too, when she was distraught over her father.

We promised to go to Aomori together.

Proud, passionate Makise Kurisu. Always strong, or at least pretending to be. A little nosy, too, and serious to a fault.

<PRE @box00>[text00480]
Before I knew it, she had become the center of the lab.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00490]

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00500]

<PRE @box00>[text00510]
I listened enraptured whenever she presented her latest theory.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00520]
At the end of the day, the reason I never called her by her name... was because I was too embarrassed.

I admired her. I longed for her. And I didn't want to admit it to myself.

Only now do I realize the truth.

I love her.


And that is why I want so desperately to save her.

I want to be with her even more. I want to talk with her even more.

I hand her Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam.

I watch her go, unable to move a muscle.

I want to stop her.

I want to wrap my arms around her and tell her to stay with me forever.

But I can't.

This is what we decided.

To save Mayuri.

To save the future.

I'm sorry, Kurisu.

I can't save you.

Kurisu will disappear.

She keeps walking.

Stride steady.

Back straight.

Long, silky hair fluttering in the wind.

She's quickly fading into the distance.

But I can tell.

I see her shoulders trembling.

We will never meet again.

"The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi."

Mayuri and Daru turn to me and nod.

Today is the last day of ComiMa. Daru wanted to attend, of course, but a little begging convinced him to prioritize the operation.

I take a look around the lab.


These twenty days have been madness. It's incredible to think that at one point, this lab had a whole eight members.

And now we're back to three.

The memories we made.

The experiences we shared.

To save Mayuri, I will undo them all.

There is sorrow in me. And guilt.


I engrave them deep inside my heart.

I'll never forget -- I mustn't forget -- these long, yet short summer days.

But still, I choose to erase our memories. I choose to return everything back to normal.

Suzuha's mission is irrelevant. I'm not doing this for the future.

As long as Mayuri lives, nothing else matters.

Daru starts typing on the IBN 5100. It's already connected to his main computer.


This will get us into SERN's central database, where they keep the data they mine with Echelon.



There we will locate the first D-Mail I sent on July 28th, and erase all trace of its existence.

With this, I can reach the Beta worldline.

At last, Mayuri will be safe.

I look at Mayuri. She's on the couch, sitting straight as a ramrod, with her grandmother's pocket watch pressed to her ear. She stays still, her eyes closed.

Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she listens to the sound of that pocket watch.

Earlier, I told Mayuri everything.

I guess she's come to terms with it, in her own way.

The actual work, I've left to Daru. No problem there.

While waiting for him to finish, I walk into the development room.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
In the center of the room is the Time Leap Machine.

I squat down and gently brush my fingers against the microwave's surface.

It's cool to the touch.

I've made irreplaceable friends because of this thing. And because of this thing, I've hurt them.

But I don't want to blame the tool.

It's how you use the tool that matters.

And I've got to admit, it's saved me more than once.

But still.

Once this is over, I'll destroy the Time Leap Machine.

We must never make the same mistakes again.

Daru points to a string of characters.

My name is there, followed by the message I wrote about Kurisu's death.

Three lines total, each twelve characters long.


This data led SERN to our doorstep.

At FB's instruction, Moeka and the Rounders attacked.

If Suzuha is right, then by erasing this data, we will escape from Attractor Field Alpha, where SERN dominates the future.

That will take us to Attractor Field Beta.

To the Beta worldline within its range of convergence.

To a future without Mayuri's death.

There, in the doorway, stands Kurisu.

Her face is flushed. Was she running?

Why is she here?

She should be on her way to the airport right now.


Kurisu is looking at me.

Her eyes are glistening, but her face is all smiles.


Did she come back for me?

In a split second of frozen time, I imagine I hear her voice.

"We didn't say goodbye," she says.

She was standing there just a moment ago.

My assistant, Christina... Makise Kurisu.

I look around the room.

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
Next to me is Daru.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
Behind me is Mayuri.

Everything is where it should be.

It looks like nothing has changed at all.

I gently touch my coat's shoulder, where Kurisu fixed a torn seam.



...It's gone.


My coat isn't torn.

The stitches, uneven from having been sewn in the dark, have disappeared.

There's no trace of that ridiculous pink thread.

I stand up and head to the development room.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
Underneath the table, the Time Leap Machine...

No.


That's not the Time Leap Machine.

That's the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

Nothing has changed. This world is exactly the same.

I knew that it would be like this.

But the fact that they forgot her existence is so saddening. So frightening.

I am the only person in the world who remembers Makise Kurisu as Lab Member 004.

So I won't forget.

I alone will live with her memory engraved upon my heart.

...Now, time to proclaim my triumph.

There are still things that must be done.

And many sacrifices were made to get here.

But despite all that, this is my victory.

I have won.

And just like that, the mask shatters. All it took was one word from Mayuri.

Mayuri, the sister I never had, the girl who always needed my protection.

I had to save her. That was my purpose.





I even sacrificed the girl I loved.


But now, I finally realize that it's over.


Mayuri is safe.

I'm... free.


Once more, I see Kurisu's face in my mind's eye.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00200]
I recall the warmth of her body.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00210]
The softness of her lips.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00220]
The weight of her last words.

One by one, they pound against my heart.

I can't bear it anymore.

Tears run down my cheeks.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4980" mode="on">

A tidal wave of emotion crashes over me. Nothing remains to hold it back.


I'll never see Kurisu again.

That knowledge shreds my heart.

I can't hold back my sobs.

I can't stop my tears.

This is the world I've been searching for.

A world where Mayuri does not die.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
And yet, it is missing the person most precious to me.

It's too much.

It's too cruel.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00260]
Why did it have to be Kurisu?

Why was I forced to choose?


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00270]
Why did she send me off with a smile!?



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
I cling to Mayuri.

She strokes my hair gently.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00290]
I surrender to my grief.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00300]
Three days have passed since then, and Mayuri is still alive.

Moeka and the Rounders have not attacked, and Tennouji has shown no sign of moving against us.

Daru has been visiting MayQueen as usual, while Mayuri has been working on costume designs for next ComiMa. Everything is back to normal.

Everything... save for the hole in my heart.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00310]
<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4981" mode="on">
"Phew. That's that."

I'm standing by the dumpster out back of the lab.

We just finished dumping the last of the trash.


This morning, I called Daru, and together we dismantled the PhoneWave and the IBN 5100.

"Come on. I'll get you a new microwave."

We no longer need the PhoneWave, that miraculous time machine built by coincidence.



It brought Kurisu into my life.


But at the same time, it made many people suffer.


It must never be used again. Not by me. Not by anyone.


It's time for the PhoneWave to die. And with it, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, lord of space and time.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00350]
I gaze once more upon the scrap heap that was Future Gadget No. 8.

We stripped it down to the last bolt and circuit board. Surely no one can rebuild it now.

Time travel is too much power for any human to wield.

We don't need D-Mails or time leaps.

Even if nothing in the future is guaranteed.

Even though I may die tomorrow.

Life was never meant to be redone.

And that's fine by me.

Wouldn't you say so too, Kurisu?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00360]
I look up at the sky, and even though it's the middle of the day, I can see a single star shining.

Maybe it's Venus.

Which suddenly reminds me.

That's what Kurisu said.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
When I get there, I find it cordoned off. The roof was off-limits to begin with, but now it's also part of a crime scene. As if I needed another reminder of the murder that took place here three weeks ago.

I duck under the yellow tape and open the door.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00040]
I can hardly breathe after running up the stairs to get here. As I gasp for air, I look across the stark white concrete.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
What is that thing?



I mean, it <I>looks</i>⑰ like Suzuha's time machine.

But there's something different about it.




Suzuha's looked old and beat up. This one looks brand new.


It's not stuck in the wall, either.

And besides, this is the Beta worldline, where SERN's dystopia never forms. Suzuha has no reason to travel to 2010.



That satellite shouldn't be here.

And yet, I feel like I've seen it before.

Where?


When did I...

Of course! It was at Doctor Nakabachi's presentation!

Right before the presentation started, something shook the building like an earthquake. And when I went to check the roof, this satellite was sitting there.

Though still confused, I approach the satellite.

The way she puts it makes it sound like she's never met me before.

And now that we're talking face to face, I realize that there's something very different about her.

For starters, what's with all the camo?

It looks dirty and worn, like she's been fighting in it for a while.

She's even carrying a gun, for some reason, and I'm pretty sure it's not a replica.


Is she really Amane Suzuha?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_4992" mode="on">
"Hold on. Just hold on one second."

This doesn't make sense!


No, calm down. Figure this out, Okabe.


You know that this is impossible.

Suzuha <I>can't</i>⑰ be here.

She leapt to 1975 in her one-way time machine. She found the IBN 5100, made sure it would get to you, then passed away in the year 2000.

It's unbelievable.

In the future of the Alpha worldline, SERN used their time machine to fashion a dystopia where no one could oppose their rule.

Suzuha traveled to the past to change that. She showed me how to escape that convergence.

The result is this, the Beta worldline. Here, SERN fails to complete its time machine.

I can't refuse.

I <I>literally</i>⑰ can't refuse.

I saw this time machine once before. On July 28th, that fateful day.


Shortly before Kurisu was killed, I saw it standing in this very spot, as sure as it is standing before me now.

There's only one thing that can mean.


It has already been established that this time machine will appear on that day, in this place.

Even before I sent the first D-Mail, my participation was assured. Even the thought of turning Suzuha down now is meaningless.

Nothing is coincidence. Everything is inevitable.

The revelation makes me dizzy.

Ever since I returned to this worldline, I've avoided all news of Kurisu's murder.

I was afraid of setting that "result" in stone.

So I still I don't know who killed Kurisu. I don't know how or why she died. I don't know anything at all.

If I had known it would come to this, would I have looked things up?

I ask myself that question. The answer is no.

Suddenly, there's a zapping sound, and countless faint silver lights start floating around the cylinder.

They look like moth dust. Or powdered snow.

The lights slowly change colors.

Violet. Blue. Green. Yellow, orange, and red. Back to silver. Violet. Blue...

The colors of the rainbow?

I feel pressure on my entire body, similar to the sensation you feel as you ascend in an elevator.


In an elevator, you feel as if you're being pulled downwards. But instead, the time machine feels like it's pulling at my back.

The feeling of pressure quickly increases.

It starts to feel like I'm falling horizontally. I've never experienced anything like this. It's so uncomfortable, I want to scream.

The strangest thing is that the time machine itself isn't shaking. In fact, it doesn't seem to be moving at all.

There's no noise. No vibration. It's eerie.




The pulling sensation grows even stronger.

I can hear my bones creaking.

I imagine my body flattened like a pancake. It's not a pleasant thought.


<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5050" mode="on">
"Guh...uh...!"


It's getting worse!

I look at Suzuha. She has her eyes shut and her jaw clenched tight.


I can no longer move. It feels like my back is glued to the wall.

My vision begins to warp.

And within my warping vision, the powder of light still shifts through the colors of the rainbow.

It's strangely beautiful, like something out of a painting.

And still I keep falling.

Where is it taking me? Through a tunnel in space-time?

All I know is that I'm falling.

If so, then this is July 28th.

The day Kurisu and I first met.

The day I sent the first D-Mail.

The day it all began.

Suzuha takes out a digital watch.

It's a fairly old-fashioned design.

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_0991" mode="on">
"I bought it in 1975, but it's not even three years old yet."

<PRE @box00>[text00230]

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
That was a close one.

I nearly bumped into myself on the 8th floor landing.

Right after I ran downstairs to the 7th floor, I heard footsteps running the other way behind me. Those footsteps were mine, no doubt. It was a near miss.

To be safe, I descend to the 4th floor before stopping to take a breath.

I take a look around, but there's nobody paying attention to me.

I wonder what Suzuha is doing. I'm worried, but I need to focus on my own mission.


I must prevent Kurisu's death.

In about 30 minutes from now, just after Nakabachi's presentation ends, someone will murder her.


I know where it happens. In the 8th floor hallway, towards the back of the building, where people rarely go.

What I don't know is who stabbed her.

Instead of running around and drawing attention to myself, I should just wait at the scene.

Let's cool off here for about five minutes, and then head over there.

If I remember correctly, Kurisu tried to talk to me in the assembly hall, but I blew her off and came down here.

After that, I tried calling Mayuri, but her phone was off and I couldn't get through, so I went back up to the assembly hall to find her. 

What time was that?



I search my memories, trying to plot the actions I took on July 28th. It sounded simple when Suzuha said it, but staying away from my past self is going to take more work than I thought.

Frustration mounts. I shove Suzuha's watch into my pocket to quash it.

Just then--

She steps back in surprise and fear, clutching a manila envelope to her chest.


This is our first meeting. I know that. But to me, she's still the girl I love. 


If I'd been thinking straight a second ago, I would have realized that my plan to grab her and flee wasn't going to work. Kurisu would never follow some strange man she only just met.


Running isn't an option.

All I can do is wait at the scene of the crime.

Fighting against the urge to stay, I force myself to turn and leave.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5062" mode="on">
"Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who!"

Someone in the audience is shouting at Doctor Nakabachi.


And that someone is me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00230]
Now I remember. I confronted Doctor Nakabachi in the middle of his presentation. I called him a fraud for ripping off John Titor's posts.

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0005" mode="on">
"S-someone throw that man out!"


Staff members approach. Damn, this is embarrassing.

But there's nothing I can do here. I need to leave before Kurisu appears.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00240]
I turn around and head deeper into the dim passage.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00250]
An image flashes through my mind. She was lying there, at the end of this passage, in a puddle of her own blood.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00260]
Twenty minutes from now, that's exactly what will happen.

Can I prevent it?

...I must. Whatever it takes.


There's a pile of junk -- toolboxes, cardboard, and the like -- about halfway down the passage. The perfect hiding spot. I crouch behind them.

Now all I have to do is wait for Kurisu to show.

But what will I do when she does?

Only now do I realize that I'm completely unarmed. I really didn't think this through.



Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. That means her killer had a weapon.

Since I didn't hear a gunshot, it must have been a knife, or something similar. How am I going to defend her -- and myself?


Is there anything around here that might work as a weapon?

I still have about 20 minutes.

But one wrong move, and someone might catch me. I shouldn't leave this spot.

Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but this is my only chance to prevent Kurisu's death. I don't want to jeopardize that.

I don't know what I'd do if I ran into Kurisu again. It's a miracle that I managed to tear myself away last time.



<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5063" mode="on">
"...Haah."

The longer I wait in the darkness, the harder it becomes. The anticipation is killing me.

So far, not a single soul has passed down this hallway.

I can faintly hear Nakabachi's voice through the mic from far away, but that's it.

The silence does nothing but increase my tension.

To make matters worse, it's hot and humid. I guess the air conditioner's not on back here.

My entire body's drenched in sweat, and I haven't even been hiding for a minute.

Sweat drips from my brow to the floor.

I rub it out with my shoe.

I have to keep waiting.

There's no other choice.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00270]
I stay there, crouched in the darkness, for what seems an eternity.

In the distance, I hear the sound of sparse applause.

I glance at Suzuha's watch. It's 12:26.

I guess the presentation's over.

I peek out from behind the boxes, and just then--

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00280]
I hear footsteps approaching.

I quickly duck back behind cover.

My heart is pounding.

Someone's coming this way.


Who? Is it Kurisu's murderer?

I clench my teeth and try to drive away the tension.

I can only pray that I won't be found.

Finally, the footsteps pass right by my hiding spot.

Moving only my eyes, I sneak a glance at the person.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00290]
<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2798" mode="on">
"..."

Kurisu?

There's no one with her.

I didn't expect Kurisu to be the first to appear.

What is she doing back here? This area is for employees only.



Now that I think about it, Kurisu's murder made no sense.

Why was she killed in a place she would normally never come?

Careful to keep quiet, I watch Kurisu from the shadows.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00300]
About five meters down the hall, she stops walking and leans against the wall.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00310]
She's holding that manila envelope I saw her with earlier. She peeks inside and smiles softly.

Why is she smiling?

Kurisu rarely smiles like that.

I mean, it's more like her to glare at people.

That envelope...


I search my memories again. When Kurisu approached me during Nakabachi's presentation, I'm pretty sure she was holding that envelope. 

But did she have it when I discovered her body?

I don't remember seeing it.


What could be inside to make Kurisu smile like that?

I can't begin to imagine.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00320]
Kurisu hasn't moved a muscle.

She's just standing there, head hung, her face hidden behind her long hair. I can't read her expression.

Is she waiting for someone?

Who?

Who would she meet in a place like this?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00330]
That's when I hear another set of footsteps approaching.

I can't see who it is from where I'm hiding.

But given the timing, it has to be the person who killed Kurisu!


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00340]
And as proof, Kurisu raises her head, and upon recognizing the newcomer, lifts her back off of the wall. Her expression softens slightly.

The footsteps come even closer.

Who is it?

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2799" mode="on">
"...I wanted to talk."

Kurisu suddenly starts speaking.

The footsteps pass right by my hiding spot.

I'm so tense, I can't move a muscle.

Doctor Nakabachi!

I slap a hand over my mouth to keep from shouting in astonishment.



Kurisu and Doctor Nakabachi know each other!?

"Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00380]
Something else occurs to me.

Why would Kurisu, an accomplished scientist, attend the presentation of a man like Nakabachi?

He's just a two-bit inventor. Only fifteen people came to hear him speak, and that's including trolls like me. There wasn't even any press coverage.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00390]
Besides, Kurisu hates time travel science.

That much was obvious from her lecture at ATF.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00400]
In that case, it's obvious why she's here.

She didn't come to see his presentation.

She came to see <I>him</i>⑰.

But why?

What could be the connection?

...Wait.

It can't be...

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2800" mode="on">
"Are you listening, Papa?"


Papa...

He's her <I>father</i>⑰... her estranged father, who she told me she hadn't seen in seven years.





Kurisu did say that her father was a physicist.

And Nakabachi certainly is a physicist, though the scientific community at large has rejected his research.


But wait... does this mean that Nakabachi killed his own daughter?




Or was it someone else, someone who has yet to appear?


There's no way to know.


If I could be sure that Nakabachi was the killer, then I would intervene right now.

But I'm not. I'd better keep watching, see what happens.

Kurisu wrote a paper on time travel!?

So that's what it was.

She didn't have anything dangerous in that envelope, like drugs or a gun. It was just some document.

But that raises a new question.

Could that be the Nakabachi Paper?




According to Suzuha, that document sparked a time travel arms race that ultimately led to World War Three and the deaths of 5.7 billion people.

As soon as I switch it on, I see a news reporter standing in some foreign airport.

There's a jumbo jet in the background. Looking closer, I see burns near the plane's tail.

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0009" mode="on">
"Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow."

When I see his face, my breath catches in my throat.

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0013" mode="on">
"Doctor Nakabachi, real name Makise Shouichi, made these comments to the press earlier today."

I still haven't recovered from the shock of murdering Kurisu. The images on the TV seem like something from a dream.

Did they say Nakabachi sought asylum in Russia?


I didn't think people still did that in this day and age. I mean, all you need is a passport to travel to Russia.




<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0046" mode="on">
"I am delighted to have arrived safely in this wonderful country. My deepest gratitude to the Russian government for accepting me."

"What happened on the plane?" read the subtitles at the bottom of the screen.

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0047" mode="on">
"When the cabin filled with smoke, I remained perfectly calm. Some passengers panicked, but they settled down after I gave them a talking to."

He certainly doesn't look like a man who could strangle his own daughter.

"My compliments to the pilot for his safe landing. He's a hero, for he saved not only my life, but my historic thesis as well."

"This thesis describes the first practical theory of time travel! Do you understand!? Time travel! I, Doctor Nakabachi, have succeeded where countless others have failed!"

Nakabachi's tone quickly grows feverish.

Now he's talking directly to the camera.

Moreover, he's not talking about the accident at all. He's just promoting his research.

He presents something to the camera.

It's the envelope. The one Kurisu gave him.

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0052" mode="on">
"This envelope contains the future of mankind! Soon, all of our dreams shall be realized! When I present this thesis to the scientific community, the world will change forever, and I will be known as the father of the time machine!"

I have no right to condemn Nakabachi for his actions, not when it was my hand that took Kurisu's life.

But at the same time, I can't stop myself from recalling the words Kurisu spoke, that hurt, betrayed tone that triggered Nakabachi's violence.

"However! Fate intervened on my behalf, as if God himself had decreed that my greatness should be known across the world!"

She's right.

When was that again?

July 28th. Right after I met Kurisu for the first time.


Just as I was about to contact Mayuri, I received a mysterious video mail from an address I had never seen before.


Is that what she's talking about?

<PRE @box00>[text00010]
I'm not convinced, but I check my phone anyway, just to be sure.

And there, I find a saved video mail.

When I check the sender's address, I realize that it's from the same address as the D-Mail just now.

So they're from the same person. And this person... is me in fifteen years?

Fifteen years. 2025. The year I die, according to Suzuha.

I sent this message on the eve of my death, a message to myself in 2010.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
Suzuha said that there was a plan to reach Steins Gate.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
Could that plan be in this video?

Mayuri and Daru peek over my shoulder.

I take a deep breath...

And press play with a trembling finger.

I follow Suzuha into the time machine.

While waiting for Mayuri to return, I asked Suzuha if there was a chance that I might run into myself from last time -- in other words, the me who killed Kurisu.

She replied that wasn't possible.

The worldline where I killed Kurisu is minutely different from the one to which the time machine will take us.

Time travel has a very small effect on divergence, much too small to cause any noticeable changes, but enough to ensure that there can never be two versions of the same time traveler. 


However, it is important to remember that worldlines are not parallel worlds.

Ultimately, attractor field convergence merges them into a single worldline.

My actions are not meaningless. If I succeed in deceiving both myself and the world, the entire universe will converge upon a different future.

When Doctor Nakabachi defected to Russia on August 21st, he had Mayuri's Metal Upa with him.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00520]
I watch as Mayuri finishes signing her name. She nods in satisfaction, then runs after the first me.

Just before she gets to the stairs, she puts the Upa into her coat pocket.

But it doesn't go in all the way. As she runs up the stairs, I see it fall out and roll away.


Mayuri is completely oblivious. A moment later, she disappears from sight.

I look at the Upa lying on the floor.

Does Nakabachi pick it up?

How? He's in the middle of his presentation upstairs. He doesn't have any opportunity.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00530]
That's when Kurisu comes up from downstairs.

I quickly hide in the stairwell across the landing.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00540]
Kurisu reaches the seventh floor without noticing me. She finds the fallen Upa and picks it up.

So it was Kurisu who found the Upa...

The Butterfly Effect.

In three weeks, this completely innocuous event changes the outcome of an accidental fire on one of what must be thousands of planes flying that day.

By extension, it changes the fate of the entire human race.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00550]
Kurisu looks curiously at the Upa, then looks around as if searching for the owner.

Of course, Kurisu doesn't know who Mayuri is.

At this point in time, those two aren't even acquainted yet.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00560]
After realizing there's no one around, Kurisu puts the Upa into her envelope and goes up to the eighth floor.

I grip the Cyalume Saber and shake it silently, thus activating the red fluorescent reaction inside.



It'll last about 10 minutes. It should get dim before Kurisu makes her appearance.

The problem is that my window of opportunity is so slim.

Will I be able to handle the enraged Doctor Nakabachi?

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
There they are. Kurisu has come, right on time.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
She leans against the wall and looks inside her envelope, smiling softly as she does.

And now, I know the reason behind that smile.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
It's the Upa inside.

She's probably smiling at how adorable it is.

That smile really doesn't suit you, Kurisu.

I stifle a chuckle.

I'm surprised I'm calm enough to feel that way, despite the current situation.

Once Nakabachi appears, that's my signal to spring into action.

I'll bring out the Cyalume Saber as soon as that bastard tries to take out his knife.

Then I'll scare him away and stun Kurisu.

The stun gun I brought should handle both tasks flawlessly.

That's the plan, at least.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00080]
The next set of footsteps echoes down the hallway.

Kurisu looks up.

I can't see Nakabachi, but I know it's him.

The atmosphere is far from pleasant. Nakabachi doesn't even try to hide his displeasure.

And the first me is probably at fault for that. At least partially.

Looks like it's about time for Nakabachi to go ballistic.

I grip the Cyalume Saber and make one final check.

It's already dimmed down. Now all I have to do is remove the cap at the tip, and the fake blood will--

In the darkness of my hiding spot, I bring the Cyalume Saber close to my eyes and peer inside.

The fake blood has begun to coagulate.

No. This shouldn't happen. I was certain the liquid would remain fluid for around 30 minutes after losing luminescence.

Was it defective!?

Come to think of it, we never tested the Cyalume Saber.

It can only be used once before the tube needs to be replaced. Given the lab's financial situation, we thought it would be a waste to use it, so we never did.

Nakabachi puts his hands around Kurisu's neck.

Her cries of agony fill my ears.

There's still a way to prevent Kurisu's death.

That puddle of blood I saw beneath Kurisu's body.

There's one more way to reproduce it.

One more way.

One last chance.



It's a gamble, to be sure. Even if it succeeds, I don't know what effect it might have on the Steins Gate worldline.

Which worldline's Suzuha was that again?

Anyway, back then, we searched all over Akiba for that pin.

And while I was hospitalized, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to ask Daru to have them made.

And of course, the one we commissioned to make them was that shady foreign street vendor.

"Okabe, Shiina, Hashida. And then Urushibara and Faris. I got those. But what about M, K, and A? Who are they?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5327" mode="on">
"..."

M for Makise.

K for Kiryu.

A for Amane.

But the current Mayuri wouldn't understand.

Those three were lab mems on a worldline undone and forgotten.

I haven't told Mayuri or Daru about them.

They wouldn't believe me even if I told them. Especially about the last initial, A.

I mean, how do I tell Daru he's going to have a daughter?

I can just imagine his reaction.

I remember.

As I lay dying in the time machine, Suzuha gripped my hand and said...

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_1070" mode="on">
"Once we arrive, I'll probably disappear. I won't be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate."

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_1071" mode="on">
"So I'll thank you now."

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_1072" mode="on">
"Thank you, Uncle. Don't die. Live."

Just as she predicted, Suzuha vanished the moment we returned to August 21st.

Right before my very eyes, the time machine was enveloped in rainbow light and disappeared.

She was smiling as she faded away.

That was proof I had reached Steins Gate.


And that's why I don't mourn Suzuha.

<voice name="Suzuha" class="VID_SUZ" src="voice/SUZ_1073" mode="on">
"And in seven years... let's meet again, okay?"

I don't know what the future will bring. There's still the possibility that Daru won't get married -- that Suzuha won't be born.

But still, I believe. That in seven years, we will meet again.

And that's when I will give her this pin, her birthright as Lab Mem 008.


Until then, I'll keep it in a safe place.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00640]
I aimlessly head out to town, alone.

I want to get a better look at the Steins Gate worldline.

But try as I may, I can't find anything drastically different.

Way back when, Faris's D-Mail erased the moe shops from Akiba. That time, it was obvious that the world had changed.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00650]
I feel unsatisfied, so I look up at Radio Kaikan.

Obviously, there's no satellite stuck in the roof.

It's open for business as usual.

When I arrived on this worldline, right after I saw Suzuha disappear, the very first thing I did was ask Mayuri and Daru a question.

"Have there been any murders at Radio Kaikan?"

As they panicked at the sight of my bloodstained body, they answered that no one had been murdered at Radio Kaikan.

As we waited for the ambulance to arrive, I had Daru call up the news on my phone.

They were running the story about Nakabachi's flight to Russia.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00660]
This time, Nakabachi looked terribly agitated.

His eyes were bloodshot. He was yelling, spraying spit everywhere. His appearance was strikingly similar to how I last saw him in the hallway of Radio Kaikan.

To me, his unintelligible rambling was evidence of Operation Skuld's success.

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0096" mode="on">
"This is an outrage! An outrage!! A fire!? How can that happen!?"

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0097" mode="on">
"My precious thesis was burned to a crisp! The future of humanity went up in flames! This is no time for an interview!"

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0098" mode="on">
"I won't stand for this, Russian Airlines! I'll murder every last one of your crew members!"

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0099" mode="on">
"Money's not the issue! Aren't you listening!? You burned my thesis! My thesis, which would have changed human history forever!"

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0100" mode="on">
"I should never have let you fools handle my suitcase! None of this would've happened if I'd just carried it with me!"

The subtitles read "What was your thesis about?"

<voice name="Nakabachi" class="VID_NAK" src="voice/NAK_0101" mode="on">
"Time travel! The invention that can grant control over all space-time, from past to present to future!"

The screen immediately returned to the studio, where a female reporter continued.

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0014" mode="on">
"This outburst continued for some time."

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0015" mode="on">
"Doctor Nakabachi, also known as Makise Shouichi, was detained by Russian authorities upon arrival at Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow."

<voice name="Female Reporter" class="VID_ETF" src="voice/ANA_0016" mode="on">
"Makise is currently under investigation by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department as a suspect in the July 28th stabbing of a young man--"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00670]
I don't think anyone's going to listen to Nakabachi now.

For argument's sake, let's say Nakabachi manages to recreate Kurisu's thesis from memory.

Nothing will come of it as long as Kurisu is alive.

The scientific community undoubtedly trusts the Makise daughter over the father, meaning Kurisu can deter any attempts made by Nakabachi.

World War Three won't break out. Or at the very least, it won't be over the Nakabachi Paper.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00680]
I haven't seen Kurisu.

Apparently, Kurisu reported to the police that I was stabbed. But at present, there has been no progress on the investigation, as the victim -- from their point of view -- up and disappeared.

I heard from Daru that no one was murdered at Radio Kaikan, and I couldn't find a single report of anyone dying in the area that day.

Kurisu is still alive. That much is certain. But I haven't had any contact with her since then.

Aside from the few words we exchanged at Radio Kaikan, the current Kurisu and I are strangers. Besides, I was bedridden, so it's not like I could have gone to see her even if I had wanted to.

Kurisu said that she was supposed to go back to America in August.

That was on the Alpha worldline, so things may have changed. But what reason would she have to stay in Japan after what her father did to her?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00681]
I thrust my hand into my pocket.

Two pins remain.

One of them is for Lab Mem 001. That's me.

The remaining badge, which belongs to Lab Mem 004, may never reach its rightful owner.

But Kurisu is alive, and that's good enough for me.



I once chose to let her die.

I once killed her with my own two hands.

But this time, I was able to save her.

No one remembers those three weeks we spent with Kurisu.

No one but me. I will remember. I will never forget.

So I don't need anything else. I don't want anything else.

Hey, Kurisu.

I don't know what the future holds.

War may still break out.

SERN may still complete their time machine.

But at the very least, the future is undecided.


We're building it now. From the bottom up. Not just me. Not just you. But every man, woman, and child.

So keep on watching, wherever in this wide world you may be.

I take out my own pin and fasten it to my chest.

I walk through the sea of shoppers, staring straight ahead.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5328" mode="on">
"...eh?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00700]
I quickly turn around.

Just now, in the corner of my eye, I saw her.

The girl who shouldn't be here.

Her long hair fluttered as she passed me by.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00710]
There.

A familiar figure. I'd recognize that back anywhere.

She has stopped too, in the middle of the sidewalk.



Slowly, slowly, she turns to face me.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00720]
It's her.

I thought she had gone back to America.

It's her.

She doesn't even know me.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2878" mode="on">
"It's you!"

That voice.

That face.

That hair.

Those eyes.

Makise Kurisu is standing there, the same as I remember her.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2879" mode="on">
"I've been looking everywhere for you!"

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2880" mode="on">
"Ever since you saved my life."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2881" mode="on">
"I was afraid I'd never have a chance to say thank you."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2882" mode="on">
"I'm so glad we could finally meet."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2883" mode="on">
"Thank you. Thank you so much."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2884" mode="on">
"And thank goodness you're alright."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00730]
Kurisu looks so radiant as she tries to hold back her tears.

Just when I thought I had finally suppressed it, all my love for her flows out at once.

I'm so happy that I want to cry too.

So, to hide my embarrassment, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5329" mode="on">

<PRE @box00>[text00750]

I have no idea what to say.

She's still staring at me with those wide, pleading eyes.

I open my mouth.

"Eh?"

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00780]
Now I really have no idea what to say.

How does this Kurisu know about that?

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00790]
Those were the names I used to tease Kurisu.

She always got mad whenever I used them.

They were our bond, our private joke.

But I had yet to use them on the day we first met at Radio Kaikan.




</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00800]
So how could this worldline's Kurisu know?



</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00810]
<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_2887" mode="on">
"Huh? I... why did I say that?"

"Words just... popped into my head..."

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00820]
It looks like Kurisu is as confused as I am.

She stares at me, bewildered.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00830]
And then, I finally realize the truth.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00840]
Everyone has Reading Steiner.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00850]
Even if the worldline changes. Even if the past and the future are rewritten.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00860]
Your memories remain.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00870]
You've merely forgotten. All it takes is a push, and you can remember.

<PRE @box00>[text00880]

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5334" mode="on">
"Welcome back, my assistant, Makise Kurisu -- no, Christina."

I reach into my pocket and take out the last pin.

Nobody knows what the future holds.

And that is why, just as this reunion demonstrates, the possibilities are endless.

I place the pin in Kurisu's hand. I gently close her hand in mine.

And, holding back my tears, I tell her...

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_5335" mode="on">
"This is the choice of Steins Gate."
