You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil.

Ohio was the first place in America to allow a black man to have a government job and the first place in America to give Muslims true equality. But something happened.. it all started with the vietnam war and bangladeshi independence.. Ohio was outraged by Nixon and his ideas of warmongering, ohio protested his war, his evil ideas. Nixon labeled us as uneducated hippies, ohio needed idols to keep our spirits high,, we turned to figures of the past for inspiration, the biggest of which were Abe Lincoln, Atat\u00fcrk, Martin Luther King Jr!\u00a0 But Nixon was not a fan of our philosophy, Nixon would ordered soldiers to match into ohio, to patrol a university, kent state university.. if the soldiers noticed anything anti American or anti government or anti war they were ordered to open fire.\u00a0 Kent was a testing ground.. if successful they would implement this scare tactic in every ohioan town. But it didn't go well, the students of Kent peacefully protested against the soldier, the soldiers counted that as treason and open fired ordered to kill anything that moved.. lucky they only killed 4 before realizing that this order was fucked up... some soldiers even attempted to cover up the incident by claiming students attacked them first by throwing small objects at them... \n\nThis horrible attack lit America on fire. It revealed the true monster that Nixon was, it also showed how ohio wouldn't stand for the cruelty against other nations. America didn't lose the vietnam war because of inconfidence, they only sued for peace when their interest were threatened at home, ohio won, but our victory would lead to the downfall of ohio.. ohio lost a lot of government funding, ohio gave her live so people in vietnam and bangladesh could have a chance at a future, the only reason our state stays afloat Is due to Japanese investment, Japanese companies, and Japanese aid. Japan is our life support. \n\nAtat\u00fcrks, Lincolns and kings vision kept ohio united against all odds, I do visit the statue of Atat\u00fcrk quite regularly, it's kinda near my area, and I've visited the Kent memorial a few times.

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.", "/u/Putrid_Ad_7413: That's the most attention I ever got \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f thx \ud83e\udd70"], ["/u/Putrid_Ad_7413: Good thing I don't like Mercedes even tho I'm albanian", "/u/frosted06: Flair up or you like rama", "/u/nerti_una: It can get worst, he can like birisha", "/u/frosted06: Both bad options in my opinion", "/u/nerti_una: Ah for sure, and then there is Meta.

Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless."], ["/u/Penguin-of_Interest: I wish they could just nuke it", "/u/phobug: Nah man, Nukes mean even more cancer for the balkans, we don't need anymore of that, thank you.

The hungarians that form the arrow shaped mass in the middle of romania are called szekelys. They are a hungarian speaking people that were sent to the edges of hungary to guard the borders in exchange for tax exemption. Szekelys can be found in Romania, Serbia and Slovakia if I am not mistaken.\n\nI am not sure if szekelys are ethnic hungarians or a group of hungarians (like moldovans are romanians) and we need a magyar to answer as they may hold the most pertinent answer. A hungarian cannot tell me that moldovans are not romanians and I cannot say that szekelys are not magyars.\n\nNow, why are there so many of them there?\n\nWell, that place has the main passes through the mountains towards Moldova and Muntenia(Wallachia) and was in the middle of the most used routes for raiders, ergo that's where the szekelys were concentrated. \n\nIn times of peace, such a place close to mountain passes would experience booming economy due to trade,so the szekelys flourished and expanded.(there are many market towns in that area)\n\nWhy are they still there now?\n\nThey don't want to go \"back\" to Hungary, because that is their land, that's where they were born and have lived in for centuries, why leave?\n\nRomania also did not try to assimilate or exterminate them. As long as they don't want independence or autonomy they are left to their own devices. (Which are shockingly just as corrupt as ours)\n\nThe area is pretty poor but the people are hardy, diligent and proud. They fix their homes as best they can and are very helpful and polite, there's a very cozy feel there, from the bottom of my heart I hope you all take a short trip through that area if you have the opportunity.", "/u/s67and: >I am not sure if szekelys are ethnic hungarians or a group of hungarians (like moldovans are romanians) and we need a magyar to answer as they may hold the most pertinent answer.

Obviously the Hungarian government says that they are 100% pure Hungarians. Meanwhile I've been wondering why we call them something different then.

What's special about this new age of grifters is just how effective and widespread they are thanks to online algorithms recommending their content to millions of kids with the exact vulnerabilities needed for the radicalisation to work. Algorithms recommend things to people with similar trates that watched said thing, so this is by design, and easily exploited.\n\nIt starts with a teen laughing at some silly smegma male influencer, causing them to start watching hundreds more videos, which expose them to more and more questionable ideas, softening them to hateful and radicalised content they'll inevitably get recommended. Many zoomers who grew up with the internet can recall exposure to these kinds of videos at some point in their life and, while many realised they were wrong and grew out of it, several continue down this path, watching explicitly hateful content by literal Nazis like Fuentes or our own homegrown equivalents here in the Balkans, or engaging in incel forums that activly encourage violence for revenge.\n\nThe thing is, Tate doesn't do all of this. Hes just one of many that is complicit in setting kids down a path leading to them getting exposed to what actually encourages them shoot schools. This makes it so hard to stop, because he can plead innocence, and pretend to be satire; another guy will take his place; they're already dozens more like him.\n\nIdk how you stop this radicalisation hydra, other than providing kids with desperately needed education on acceptance, mental health and learning what to avoid online.\n\n>!srry for the long ass essay!<", "/u/fbdewit31: Well said"], ["/u/Intrazonal: Mek\u00e2n\u0131 u\u00e7ma\u011f olsun, onlar art\u0131k babam\u0131z\u0131n/anam\u0131z\u0131n yan\u0131nda daha rahat hayat s\u00fcreceklerdir eminim...", "/u/Medium_Rip6034: Write in english", "/u/Intrazonal: Rest in peace, i'm sure they will live a more comfortable life next to our father/mother..."], ["/u/Intrazonal: Mek\u00e2n\u0131 u\u00e7ma\u011f olsun, onlar art\u0131k babam\u0131z\u0131n/anam\u0131z\u0131n yan\u0131nda daha rahat hayat s\u00fcreceklerdir eminim...", "/u/Medium_Rip6034: Write in english", "/u/Intrazonal: Mutlu oldun mu?", "/u/Medium_Rip6034: Yeessss \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "/u/Intrazonal: Mutlu olduysan ne mutlu bana", "/u/Medium_Rip6034: \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 (I am least gay turk)"], ["/u/bongiovist: As an Atheist sometimes i want to believe there is justice and a better life just because of this kind of sadness happening to innocent lost lives\u2026 RIP KOMSHU", "/u/Nirados: What does Komshu mean?

Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.", "/u/Matej_the_IceFox: This is the most beautiful insult the world has ever seen", "/u/TuxedoMask29: So Beautiful that no felt insulted"], ["/u/yourCHAD-neighbor: When i saw Romania flags and first thing i did read is Andrew tate's villa i thought someone robbed him LMAO", "/u/someone755: least corrupt balkan police force", "/u/Mundane-Pay-16: Dear Unflaired,\n\nYou useless piece of shit.

The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.", "/u/Mediocre-Ad-3724: Beware, that text can get you suspended."], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/denis_denis05: Romania did warcrime?", "/u/Alexjrro9: Yes", "/u/BigCatfish-2: Nice \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa"], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/denis_denis05: Romania did warcrime?", "/u/Alexjrro9: Yes", "/u/Ok_Interview_4069: Based\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9"], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/denis_denis05: Romania did warcrime?", "/u/Alexjrro9: Yes", "/u/denis_denis05: [Nice](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/adgmqgV_700b.jpg) \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa"], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/denis_denis05: Romania did warcrime?", "/u/ovidiuxa2: Very many", "/u/denis_denis05: [Nice](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/adgmqgV_700b.jpg) \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa"], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/Turkish_Maiden: \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa"], ["/u/PaleBlueEyes0101: all of them fits for turkey bruhh", "/u/Illyrianboi: Same thing here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou5ljzu0ahda1.jpeg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2831cfe286d504cc44786cb35ddb6758ecdaf5e4", "/u/SleepTightLilPuppy: Serbians not racist?

You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I"], ["/u/Akuma721: Sometimes I get the vibe that the west just wants to use turkey for its good technology and proximity to Syria and Iraq.

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate"], ["/u/Warm_Wash_2046: I make 5000\u20ac a month by not paying taxes\ud83d\uddff\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7", "/u/turkisblunder: I'm calling Greek Police", "/u/telif_: You do it like this: MALAKA-BUDALA-HAYVAN", "/u/Faidon717: I had no idea Budala was a turkish word wtf", "/u/telif_: It is a glorious word indeed"], ["/u/Warm_Wash_2046: I make 5000\u20ac a month by not paying taxes\ud83d\uddff\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7", "/u/turkisblunder: I'm calling Greek Police", "/u/-10001: Good luck with that"], ["/u/Warm_Wash_2046: I make 5000\u20ac a month by not paying taxes\ud83d\uddff\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7", "/u/turkisblunder: I'm calling Greek Police", "/u/Georgium333: Who?"], ["/u/Warm_Wash_2046: I make 5000\u20ac a month by not paying taxes\ud83d\uddff\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7", "/u/turkisblunder: I'm calling Greek Police", "/u/Warm_Wash_2046: Nooooo"], ["/u/hotlinebrut: She's comparing about $5,000 a month.

Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline.

It's a form of a language that evolved over the millennia. \n\nThink about it in this way. What you've learned is not even 'Ancient Greek' for the simple fact that there was no common Ancient Greek language. The were various dialects and major dialects were even split into local versions. For example, the Doric dialect of Laconia (Sparta) was not exactly the same as the one of Macedonia or Crete. What you were taught (and what most people are taught when they learn 'Ancient Greek') is the Attic dialect, that is the dialect of Ancient Athens (Attica being the region of Athens). Which was certainly the most influential ancient Greek dialect because of the cultural and commercial influence of Athens which towards the end of the classical era made it useful as a bureaucratic language for the Macedonian kingdom as it expanded (in the place of its native Doric dialect)  which led to its spread across the eastern Mediterranean and beyond following the conquests of Alexander. \n\nIt's not the same situation with Latin where various forms of speech evolving from it and becoming distinct languages in their own right.\n\nThere are various reasons for this. The study of ancient texts, diglosia -- that is the existence of a higher form of the language (inspired by the Ancient Greek dialect of Athens) that has been taught and used in various ways to this day -- the use of the language as the sole official language of the later (Eastern) Roman Empire and after its fall by the Orthodox Church which effectively became an Ottoman state institution, etc. All these reasons and others  acted as an anchor that did not allow the language as a whole to change significantly to the degree that in its modern form it could be considered a different language. \n\n(Of course there were certain local dialects that emerged at some points that diverged to a degree.

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.

Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless."], ["/u/agalarla31zamani: Romanians try not to stole anything (impossible)\njust joking guys, stay safe", "/u/Interesting_Plac: But it's a fact that they stole our earthquake as well.", "/u/Electrical-Bad2023: flair up"], ["/u/agalarla31zamani: Romanians try not to stole anything (impossible)\njust joking guys, stay safe", "/u/Interesting_Plac: But it's a fact that they stole our earthquake as well.", "/u/Left-Cap-6046: https://preview.redd.it/edomgew1leia1.jpeg?width=962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86564ee20c6d843735343bc4bfd12784aad3b002"], ["/u/Background_Rich6766: it's alright guys, some minor damage to some buildings, and less than 5 people are hurt, nothing bad from what I've heard", "/u/Karamel_Ayi: Good, \n\nFun fuck: almost every hours there are aftershocks in Turkey bigger than 5.0", "/u/geobic: Not so fun fact", "/u/Karamel_Ayi: Not fun fact its fun fuck", "/u/shinebullet: No, it's sad fuck", "/u/evrenthebanger: nope its madafuck"], ["/u/Background_Rich6766: it's alright guys, some minor damage to some buildings, and less than 5 people are hurt, nothing bad from what I've heard", "/u/Karamel_Ayi: Good, \n\nFun fuck: almost every hours there are aftershocks in Turkey bigger than 5.0", "/u/geobic: Not so fun fact", "/u/telif_: Sad fact:("], ["/u/Background_Rich6766: it's alright guys, some minor damage to some buildings, and less than 5 people are hurt, nothing bad from what I've heard", "/u/Karamel_Ayi: Good, \n\nFun fuck: almost every hours there are aftershocks in Turkey bigger than 5.0", "/u/geobic: Not so fun fact", "/u/xxEmkay: While still not fun, the richter scale is base 10 logarithmic meaning each point is 10x worse. \nSo the the initial quake was 25 to 30 times as bad\u2026", "/u/DavidandreiST: Also the fun fact about the Richter Scale is that it doesn't stop at 10.

The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless."], ["/u/First-Ad684: \ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf8b\ud83c\udf8b\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b", "/u/cockttail: Vietnam?", "/u/Duschkopfe: Where\u2019s \ud83c\udf5a\ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf5a", "/u/First-Ad684: In my belly"], ["/u/Nick_The_Judge: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08", "/u/xd-ste: Grik", "/u/Overused2011meme: thiz iz grik god ogey? grik god", "/u/xd-ste: Jyou ar de week sp\u03a3rm ogey?

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.\n\nThere is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true.\n\nBy making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are.

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.\n\nMy hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.\n\nThere is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true.\n\nBy making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.\n\nBut than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure any living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time.

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\n\nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\n\nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\n\nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\n\nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\n\nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\n\nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\n\nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\n\nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\n\nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\n\nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\n\nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\n\nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\n\nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\n\nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\n\nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\n\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.\n\nYou are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.\n\nIf you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.\n\nYou are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.\n\nThe sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.\n\nI could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.\n\nWhen people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now.
