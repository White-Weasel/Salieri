Let's say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped 'crevice' with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you'd need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I'm pretty sure it's a little more than 1.21 jigowatts. Third. You'd need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course. What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel? Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn't want to take the challenge. In that case, let's consider wormholes.

They may be a little more realistic than cosmic strings. By the way, Hououin-san. Do you know what wormholes are?\n@Rintaro: It's like a shortcut through space... right?\n@Kurisu: Yes, that's correct. There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero. But oh no, there's a problem. The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens. So we need something to negate the effect of gravity. So-called 'exotic matter'. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter. Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist's 'grasping force' so that I can't squish anymore.  If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort. For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it's there, we yank it back to LA. According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole. So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he'd arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can't be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect. The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero... Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete. The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel. First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one. Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed. Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist. Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept? Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer.</s>"

So we need something to negate the effect of gravity. So-called 'exotic matter'. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter. Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist's 'grasping force' so that I can't squish anymore.  If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort. For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it's there, we yank it back to LA. According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole. So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he'd arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can't be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect. The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero... Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete. The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel. First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one. Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed. Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist. Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept? Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer.\n@Student: Isn't there anything simpler? Like something you can pull out of a drawer and just use, or something.\n@Kurisu: I'm afraid not. This is the limit of modern physics. I can't say how it might change in ten years, though. Besides, even if someone did overcome the logistical requirements, there may be other factors that prevent time travel from working. And that's because fundamental problems concerning the principle of causality have not yet been solved.\n@Rintaro: You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?\n@Kurisu: ",

You can see light from tens of thousands of years ago, can't you?\n@Student: That's not time travel either!\n@Kurisu: Well, I was just getting started. Let's say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped 'crevice' with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you'd need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I'm pretty sure it's a little more than 1.21 jigowatts. Third. You'd need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course. What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel? Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn't want to take the challenge. In that case, let's consider wormholes. They may be a little more realistic than cosmic strings. By the way, Hououin-san.

Their existence hasn't been proven yet. Not that there's any way to prove one exists.\n@Rintaro: That's right... John Titor! According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034.

If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.\n@Rintaro: If Titor's predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right.\n@Itaru: I don't know about Titor's predictions, but I've seen the problem video before.

If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there's no way to survive. The second problem is that they can't specify a physical destination. They can't choose where they end up after traveling to the past. That's why I'd say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones. Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can't be found.\n@Mayuri: Why can't they be found?\n@Itaru: Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114,000 kph--\n@Kurisu: SERN has been looking for solutions, but it's not going well.\n@Rintaro: Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?\n@Kurisu: Hmm... Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world's largest microwave oven.\n@Rintaro: Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!\n@Kurisu: You might be on to something there. However, there are too many things we don't know about the PhoneWave.

In an adjacent facility, protons are gradually accelerated by the linear accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, and the Super Proton Synchrotron. Finally, they're injected into the LHC, where they undergo their final acceleration via a series of superconducting magnets installed in the tunnel. By now, they're traveling at up to 99.9999991% the speed of light. That's enough to melt your brain. Not as dangerous as the PhoneWave, though. Finally, the accelerated protons collide approximately 1 to 10 billion times per second. The purpose of the LHC project is to study the high energy reactions that result... or so they say. We know they're a bunch of stinking liars.\n@Rintaro: And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?\n@Kurisu: Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter.\n@Rintaro: We've already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it's supposed to.\n@Kurisu: ...It's dangerous to accept that without verification.\n@Rintaro: As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is.\n@Kurisu: I don't think we're going to find it. The PhoneWave's not exactly big, you know, and we've been poking at it for days without turning up a clue. Even if we do find it, it'll take forever to learn how to tune the electron feed properly.\n@Itaru: How long is forever?\n@Kurisu: SERN's been working on it for nine years and they still haven't solved it.</s>"

Several years ago, my lab -- the Neurophysiology Lab at Victor Condoria University -- developed a technology called Visual Rebuilding, or VR for short. Put simply, it enables conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals.  Used in reverse, it can also convert nerve impulses into video data, or any other kind of electronic data. So, if we combine VR technology with my research... do you see where I'm going?\n@Itaru: ...No way.\n@Rintaro: We can convert memories into data?\n@Kurisu: Not just that. Memory transplantation, backups, external storage... all of those things become possible.\n@Rintaro: So basically, what you're saying is that we convert the subject's memories into video data... Use the LHC's black hole to compress that data into 36 bytes... Send that data through the Kerr black hole inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)... And finally, imprint those memories on the subject's brain in the past.\n@Mayuri: What does that mean?\n@Kurisu: We can send our memories back in time. In order to differentiate it from physical time travel, let's call it a 'time leap' for now. You don't go back, just your memories. It's so crazy that nobody's thought of it before. The important thing to remember is that only memories are being transferred. Personality and consciousness aren't included.\n@Rintaro: What does that mean? How is it different from what you see in sci-fi novels?\n@Kurisu: Time leaping in sci-fi usually sends everything -- consciousness, personality, and memory.

        "input,output": "<s>@Mayuri: Ehehe!\n@Rintaro: Very well. Time Leap Machine it is. Assistant! Explain for us all how the Time Leap Machine works.\n@Kurisu: In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past. Let's begin with what we all know. By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor's time machine. The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that's the 42-inch CRT downstairs. Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past. The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination. The PhoneWave now has headgear attached. This headgear records the nerve impulses in the temporal lobe of the brain -- specifically, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, where memories are stored. Then, using VR technology, we encode the nerve impulses into electrical signal data.\n@Itaru: It comes out to approximately 3.24 terabytes.\n@Kurisu: By the way, we'll set it up so that the data decodes automatically after a certain amount of time. Anybody well versed in programming can do this. I had Hashida make the code. Anyway, next we send the memory data through the net to the LHC in France.\n@Rintaro: How long does it take to send 3.24 terabytes of data?\n@Itaru: We have 64 direct lines in parallel. So if we send it in 64 parts... It should upload in about 45 seconds.\n@Kurisu: Next, we hijack the LHC, create a mini black hole, and use that black hole's supergravity to compress the data into 36 bytes.\n@Rintaro: Will the compression take long?\n@Itaru: It's practically instantaneous. 23 milliseconds or thereabouts. We're using a black hole, after all.\n@Kurisu: By the way, the compression only holds in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. Once the data leaves that area, it will begin to decompress on its own. This, too, takes 23 milliseconds.</s>"

Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things. By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data. Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own. Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future. This happens in less than a second. Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete. If the data came from one week in the future, the recipient will 'remember' that week as if he experienced it firsthand. We need to be aware that consciousness and personality aren't transferred.
